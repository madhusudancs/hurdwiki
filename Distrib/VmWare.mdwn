## <a name="Why_not_vmware_"> Why not vmware? </a>

**_Q:_** GNU won't work in [[VmWare]], it hangs when reaching the Hurd bootstrap.

**_A:_** Note that Vmware is not supported software to run the Hurd on it. Reasons include:

1. Vmware is not [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), which is against our philosophy.
2. Obtaining a licensed copy to debug it costs (at least) $300. (However, the player is "free" as in beer. This doesn't lessen the other concerns, however).
3. Vmware's sources and specification are not publicly available, which makes debugging tasks really painful.
4. GNU is not in [Vmware's official supported operating systems page](http://www.vmware.com/support/ws3/doc/ws32_guestos2.html#1034043).

We recommend to use [free](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) alternatives, like the [[BochsEmulator]]. Also check QEMU: [[HurdOnQEMU]].

I have been able to install Debian/Hurd K2 on [[VmWare]] ...

* [[VmWare]] 3.02 complains a lot about a missing **console** and shows a lot of errors
  * They can be solved by manually creating the devices
* I have tried **Bochs 2.0**, Debian/Hurd K2 installs with no problems at all.
* [[VmWare]] 4.0.0 works fine ... just follow the Hurd install instructions.-- [[TWiki/AndreaSterbini]] - 22 Apr 2003
* Here using "free" (as in beer) vmware-player 1.0.2.29634 on Gentoo. Hurd K14 installs and runs smoothly, but seems to hang on shutdown. -- [[Main/DeviceRandom]] - 20 Jan 2007
