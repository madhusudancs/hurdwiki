TCB stands for trusted computed base.  Unqualified, the trusted
computing base referrers to the set of components programs
must [[trust]] to function correctly.  On multiserver systems,
it is sometimes more appropriate to speak of the trusted computing
base of a particular program: as components are much less connected,
one program's trusted computing base may be significantly different
from another's.
