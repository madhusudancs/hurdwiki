**March 29, 2012** - Last month, I finished the third page (in french for instance). Questions about the internet are beginning to arise in this comic... [http://art9libre.tuxfamily.org/gaetan-03.php](http://art9libre.tuxfamily.org/gaetan-03.php)

**May 19, 2011** - Very difficult to do my comic on the Hurd I encountered problems of inspiration... I missed the second page but I started again [http://art9libre.tuxfamily.org/gaetan-02.php](http://art9libre.tuxfamily.org/gaetan-02.php)

**October 3, 2010** - I just try to become an end user of The Hurd. In 2004, I was able to install K9 on an old computer.
These times, my goal is to install it on my laptop (maybe with crosshurd or with a lzma image for virtualbox, or any other way...)

Also, I'm currently working on a comics'The Call Of The Hurd'. It's free licensed cc-by-sa/Copyleft Art Libre.
1st page will be done before the end of the year I think (I look for good quality).
