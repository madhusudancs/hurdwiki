## <a name="Welcome_to_http_hurd_gnufans_org"> </a> Welcome to <http://hurd.gnufans.org>!

This site focuses on providing a user-centric &amp; updatable (hopefully the most current) information possible regarding the status and development of the GNU project's GNU operating system. There are many areas to comment on the core component (the Hurd) and other very closely related but distinct projects. This is an all volunteer effort intended to supplement the [official Hurd site](http://hurd.gnu.org). If you see an error **please** fix it! It is a collaboration effort powered by TWiki software installed in May, 2002.

You must use the Grub Boot Loader (not Lilo) to boot a Debian GNU/Hurd system. A total of two gigabytes of unpartitioned disk space is more than enough for an installation. The best installation information is [available here](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install). There are also a couple different Hurd [[Hurd/FrequentlyAskedQuestions]], a freenode.net IRC [[Hurd/HurdIRC]] and several different [[Hurd/MailLists]] with searchable archives. Please make an attempt to answer your own questions first using archives, this site or drop by the IRC channel (if someone is online that can answer your question). Any possible coding time (resources) available to the core developers can then be spent working on the tough [[Hurd/KnownHurdLimits]] with the architecture. :-)

## <a name="What_specifically_is_the_Hurd_"> What specifically is the Hurd? </a>

The [[Hurd/WebHome]] is the GNU replacement for UNIX and Linux "kernels." It is a collection of servers that run on top of the [[Mach/WebHome]] microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are today implemented by the Unix, Linux or other kernels. All operating systems (including MS Windows and Apple Mac) perform these functions.

The word "Hurd" is commonly used to refer to one of the following:

* the Hurd software that runs on top of a microkernel (most precisely)
* a machine running the [[Distrib/WebHome]]
* [GNU Hurd project](http://hurd.gnu.org) including related dependent projects
* HIRD of UNIX Replacing Daemons (arguably)
  * HIRD is an acronym for HURD Interfaces Representing Depth (arguably)

The [[Hurd/WebHome]] supplies the last piece needed for a complete [[GNU/WebHome]] operating system as originally conceived by Richard M Stallman (RMS) in 1983. The GNU vision directly drove the creation and has guided the evolution of the Free Software Foundation ([FSF](http://www.fsf.org)), the organization that is the home of the entire [GNU project](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/).

## <a name="What_s_the_current_status_of_the"> What's the current status of the Hurd? </a>

An "official 1.0 release" has been a dream since 1983. Project resources are scarce. A precise time estimate is not possible. The project welcomes assistance you can provide. Porting &amp; development expertise is still badly needed in several key areas such as the DHCP &amp; PPP clients. See the More info link to the right for additional information.

Even most of the core developers do not use a Debian GNU/Hurd system as their primary day to day operating system yet. Functional systems are installable with some functionality in a dual-boot configuration. Development systems are currently based on the Debian GNU/Hurd port ([[Distrib/WebHome]]) sponsored by the [Debian project](http://www.debian.org) &amp; Debian's non-profit legal entity [SPI](http://www.spi-inc.org/).

Community resources for related projects focus around the official website <http://hurd.gnu.org>, this site at <http://hurd.gnufans.org>, the [[Hurd/MailLists]] and the [[Hurd/HurdIRC]] channel.

## <a name="Can_I_add_some_information_to_th"> Can I add some information to the pages here? </a>

Yes, this is encouraged! If you are not familiar with the TWiki collaboration tool (a Wiki type software implementation) and would like to contribute some content to the site, please visit [[TWiki/WelcomeGuest]]. Every page on the site is editable. Feel free to join in, but we do have some simple requests.

In an ideal Wiki, everyone is equal and shares equal rights, liberties, responsibilities and common sense. Please respect the guidelines described in the [[TWIKIWEBGoodStyle]] topic and please try to match the "tone" of your topics and edits with the existing topics. If we all pull in the same direction the site will be more useful for everyone, especially for our own use. No account is necessary for **browsing**. _We prefer that you create your own [[Main/TWikiUsers]] (free, relatively painless process) using the %TWIKIWEB%.TWikiRegistration page when **contributing**._ You may also use the [[Main/TWikiGuest]] account when contributing.

## <a name="How_is_this_site_arranged_"> How is this site arranged? </a>

TWiki webs (very poor terminology) are similar to "Chapters" in a book. The WebMenu on the left side holds references to these "webs" and "topics" available. Each "web" has a different color.

The Main and TWiki webs are for system use. The [[HurdGnuFansOrg]] web primarily contains information about the [[Main/TWikiUsers]] of our site. The [[TWiki/WebHome]] web primarily contains documentation about the TWiki software.

Here are some more Wiki conventions and terminology that you will see again. Each HTML page is called a topic. Each topic has a special "wiki name". [[TWiki/WikiWords]] are assumed to be topics in the current "web" unless preceded by the name of a "web" and a period. For example the previous link can also be denoted as [[TWiki/WikiWords]]. A simplified &amp; interpreted markup is used for content which can include HTML code. It sounds far more complex than it is in practical use, it's just a little different Most that understand the differences find contribution very very simple and painless.

Further information about this site and how it was created can be found in the [[TWikiColophon]]. Our site runs the custom-developed GNU skin by default. There is a [[Main/HurdGnuFansOrgDiscuss]] for discussion about the contents of this specific page as well.
