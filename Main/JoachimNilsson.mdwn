Hello, this is the page of [Joachim Nilsson](http://gnufans.org/joachim/). I'm a computer geek, dad (soon x2) with a lot of diverse interests. This wiki page displays some of them.

I am employed as an embedded systems and GNU/Linux consultant for the Swedish company Aktiebolaget �ngpannef�reningen in the city of [V�ster�s](http://www.vasteras.se). Roughly, "The Incorporated Steamboiling Association". As you might have guessed it is a very old consultant firm, stemming from 1896. Today we cover almost all engineering disciplines. See more on <http://www.afconsult.com>

Currently I have almost no time at all for any of my pet projects. Work and family is more than enough and may be so for the forseeable future.

### <a name="Hardcore_stuff"> Hardcore stuff </a>

I'm a bit involved in the GNU operating system, the Hurd. Having done some contractual work earlier on both the VxWorks Wind kernel, Linux and eCos I got interested in micro kernels. Being a free software enthusiast I am now focusing my energy on GNU/Hurd and GNU/Linux.

One of my goals is to get my SMP machine at home booting the Hurd. This is now impossible due to the unsupported external Promise ATA-100 controller, or my on-board ATA-66 controller for that matter. I may try to hack some basic ATA-33 support for GNU Mach 1.3, but not anytime soon.

I am the local [TWiki](http://twiki.org) admin guy. When I volonteered to run the Hurd wiki web on <http://vmlinux.org> I decided to create a suitable skin for it. The result is the TWiki:Plugins/GnuSkin. See it in action on the [[Hurd/WebHome]] web.
