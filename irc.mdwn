[[!meta title="IRC"]]

There are some IRC channels where Hurd topics are discussed.

Everybody is welcome to join and participate in the discussions, but please
respect the below guidelines if you want to participate.

Please try to stay on topic.  We're not interested in Emacs vs. vi discussions,
we don't want to hear why you think that the GNU project sucks, or what your
favorite GNU/Linux distribution is.

Sometimes providing a log or some other excerpt of text can
help solve a problem or answer a question.  Do not paste
the log in the channel itself if it's more than a few lines.  Instead use a
[paste bin](http://paste.debian.net).

# Regular Meetings

Starting in early 2008, there have been regular IRC meetings held between the
(now former) [[Google Summer of Code|community/gsoc]] students and their
mentors.  These meetings turned out to considerably help student-mentor
interactions, and other developers regularely took part, too.
For this reason, we decided to continue having these meetings, even if it's not
currently Google Summer of Code time.
Currently, the meetings take place in the **`#hurd` channel every
Thursday at 19:00 UTC** and are open to any interested party.  So,
everyone, take your chance to chat with GNU Hurd developers!
