A new article about [[the_authentication_server|hurd/documentation/auth]]
has been added to the web pages.  It resembles the talk
about the same topic which was given at the Libre Software Meeting,
therefore the target audience is mostly programmers which want to learn
about the details of authentication in the Hurd.
