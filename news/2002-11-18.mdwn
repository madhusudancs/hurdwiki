For one month now, the pthread implementation by Neal Walfield is part
of the Hurd CVS source tree, and has been used to compile more
software for the Debian GNU/Hurd archive.  The lack of a POSIX
compatible thread library (the Hurd was based on the cthread
implementation that originally accompanied Mach) was a show stopper,
and we are happy about the possibility to not only compile more
applications, but also to start the work on migrating the Hurd source
code to pthreads.
