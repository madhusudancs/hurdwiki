The GNU Hurd project has been accepted as a mentoring organisation for the
**Google Summer of Code 2008**!  If you are a student and looking for a job
during the summer, take a look at our
[[project_ideas_list|community/gsoc]]--here's your chance to help improving the
GNU Hurd including mentoring from our side and being paid compensation from
Google's!

The application deadline has been [**extended** to **Monday,
2008-04-07**](http://groups.google.com/group/google-summer-of-code-announce/browse_thread/thread/9fa88f31aa401f70),
so there's more time for you students to hand in your Hurd applications.
