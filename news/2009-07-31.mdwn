> Samuel Thibault uploaded a new version of the hurd
> [[Debian|hurd/running/debian]] package which improves system stability by
> fixing a long-standing bug in the [[hurd/translator/exec]] server that had
> randomly made it hang, inhibiting the creation of new processes.

> [[Sergiu Ivanov|scolobb]] implemented most of the functionality of the
> [[union mount translator|hurd/translator/unionmount]] which allows combining
> the [[filesystem trees exported by several translators|hurd/translator]] with
> the filesystem tree of the underlying node (in contrast to a pure
> [[hurd/translator/unionfs]], which won't do that).  The patches are currently
> undergoing testing and review on the [[bug-hurd mailing
> list|mailing_lists/bug-hurd]].  This work is being done as a [[Google Summer
> of Code|community/gsoc]] project, and we're happy to tell that Sergiu
> successfully passed the project's midterm evaluation.

> Also, [[Zheng Da|zhengda]] [[!GNU_Savannah_patch 6851 desc="fixed a bug"]] in GNU Mach's
> [[!wikipedia Berkeley Packet Filter desc="BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)"]]
> implementation and contributed a number of fixes and 
> improvements for [[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]] which should help further debugging.

> Aside from looking for new [[contributors|contributing]] all the time,

> we're seeking [someone interested in writing a regression test suite for Hurd
