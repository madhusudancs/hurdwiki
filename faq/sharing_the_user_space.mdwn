[[!meta title="Sharing the userspace between GNU Hurd and the Linux kernel"]]

Given that both Linux and GNU Hurd are using the [[ELF]] binary
format, it is in theory possible to have a system installation where you can
dual-boot using either the [[Linux]] kernel, or the GNU Hurd, so that
everything but the kernel is shared.
For this, all programs need to agree to rely on
only one abstraction layer, for example the standard C library ([[glibc]]).
(Additionally, for example for [[system call]]s that are not covered by glibc
calls, you'd need to be able to reliably trap and emulate these.)  However,
Linux' and the GNU Hurd's [[ABI]]'s have sufficiently diverged, so that this is
not easy to do.  That's why you can't currently install a system in this way,
but you need a separate installation of the userspace suited for the Linux
kernel, or the GNU Hurd.
