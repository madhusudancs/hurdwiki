The Hurd, together with the GNU Mach microkernel, the GNU C Library
and the other GNU and non-GNU programs in the GNU system, provide a
rather complete and usable operating system today.  It may not be ready
for production use, as there are still some bugs and missing features.
However, it should be a good base for further development and
non-critical application usage.

]] The GNU system (also called GNU/Hurd) is completely self-contained
(you can compile all parts of it using GNU itself).  You can run
several instances of the Hurd in parallel, and debug even critical
servers in one Hurd instance with gdb running on another Hurd
instance.  You can run the X window system, applications that use it such as
gnumeric, iceweasel, and advanced server applications like the Apache webserver.

The DDE environment allows for reusing half of the Linux 2.6.32 network device
drivers, and experimental support for SATA devices was added in May 2013.
On the other side, support for character devices (like sound
cards) and other hardware (USB, multicore) is mostly missing.

Although the [[POSIX
interface|faq/posix_compatibility]] is provided, some additional interfaces
like POSIX shared memory or semaphores are still under development.

We encourage everybody who is interested to try
out the current development version, and send feedback to the Hurd
developers.

[[Debian GNU/Hurd|running/debian]] closely tracks the progress of the Hurd (and
often includes new features).  They offer *LiveCDs and QEMU images* to
test-drive the Hurd, and about 78% of the Debian software archive are
available.  Along with the official Debian "jessie" release (but not as an
official Debian release), in April 2015 the [[Debian
GNU/Hurd|hurd/running/debian]] team released [[Debian GNU/Hurd
2015|news/2015-04-29-debian_gnu_hurd_2015]].

[[hurd/running/Arch_Hurd]] offers *LiveCDs* for testing and installation.

[[hurd/running/Nix]] provides QEMU images.


## Usability Reports

### Svante Signell, 2013-05-21

I have been running GNU/Hurd for some years now, with VMs, mainly in the
QEMU/KVM environment on host computers supporting hardware acceleration.
On these boxes Hurd runs decently fast with the correct KVM settings. 
On my latest box, a 4-core, 8-thread, 3.4GHz CPU, 16GiB RAM, 128GiB SSD host it
is very fast. One can not complain on execution speeds at least in a hosted 
environment. Additionally, the KVM images are very stable, you only get
into problems if you push to the limits, like memory, swap space etc.
In fact one build daemon for Debian GNU/Hurd is running under KVM and it is 
one of the fastest.

I don't use GNU/Hurd for my day-to-day business (yet), that is mainly due to
some of the above mentioned missing features. I do use it for porting packages,
mainly for the Debian GNU/Hurd distribution, partly contributing to the kernel 
development (gnumach/Hurd/gcc/gdb/libc) and running package test suites for 
checks of performance and POSIX compatibility.

When some of the missing features are implemented (and remaining bugs squeezed
out) I will seriously consider using the Hurd on real hardware, as my primary 
system. For now it stays in the VM  environment, mainly for porting and development
purposes. Why don't you try it out too?
