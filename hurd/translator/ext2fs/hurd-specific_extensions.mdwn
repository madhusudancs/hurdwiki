# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-04-20

    <Tekk_> what are the extensions to ext2?
    <Tekk_> that hurd uses
    <braunr> tha ability to store passive translator command lines in the
      inodes
    <braunr> the*
    <antrik> well, also a fourth set of permission bits, and an "author" field
    <braunr> right
    <antrik> both very obscure features that better never existed...

The fourth set of permission bits is for unknown users.

In order to take advantage of these features, the owner/creator of the
partition must be set to *hurd*.  `mke2fs`, unless specifically overridden on
the command line (`-o hurd`, for example), will set the default to whatever
system it is running on.  At least the root filesystem must be of *hurd* type,
as it has to store various passive translator settings.  Even if a file system
is not of the native type, others may still use it; they just may not be able
to use certain extensions.
