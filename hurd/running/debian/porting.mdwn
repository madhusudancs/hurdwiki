[[!meta title="Debian packages that need porting"]]

[[!tag stable_URL]]

More than half of the Debian archive has been compiled successfully on the
Hurd, however, many programs fail to build for various reasons.

A [list of build failures including error
messages](https://people.debian.org/~sthibault/failed_packages.txt) can be
found, as well as a [preliminary
analysis](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2007/07/msg00000.html) of them and [solutions](http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2007/07/msg00001.html), and some more details in [[hurd/porting/guidelines]]. [Graphs and statistics](http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/) about the consequence in terms of build dependencies are available.

There is a mailing list,
[debian-hurd-build-logs](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-hurd-build-logs),
where *builds logs from the Debian GNU/Hurd autobuilders* are posted.  It is a
high-traffic and high-volume list, and for that reason *not* archived, so you
have to subscribe to see the messages.

It might be a good idea to record your intention to port something either in
the list below or in the [Alioth task
tracker](http://alioth.debian.org/pm/task.php?group_project_id=34&group_id=30628&func=browse)
so other people do not do duplicated work.

Also, the [[community/HurdFr]] guys maintain their own [liste des travaux de
packaging](http://wiki.hurdfr.org/index.php/Liste_des_travaux_de_packaging).

Aside from the Alioth task tracker, here is a list of some packages (the
important ones, as they're, e.g., blocking other packages from being built)
that need someone to work on them.

When you have a patch to submit, please adhere to the [[patch_submission]]
guidelines.

There is also further information available about [[hurd/porting]].
