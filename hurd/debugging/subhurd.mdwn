# Debugging the Hurd Startup Process

_one.full_ is the subhurd's root file system image and has been installed as
follows: [TODO]

_Wx_ translates to terminal window _x_.

W1

    $ fsysopts one.full/ --readonly
    $ sudo boot -I -d -s -D one.full/ one.full/boot/script.boot one.full.ext2
    Pausing. . .

(In theory it shouldn't be neccessary to run the subhurd as user _root_, but in
practice [that doesn't work at the
moment](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?17341).)

W2

    $ ps -Af
    [...]
        root   851   385  p4  0:00.01 boot -I -d -s -D one.full/ one.full/boot/script.boot one.full.ext2
           -   853     1   ?  0:00.00 ?
           -   854     1   ?  0:00.00 ?
    [...]
    $ sudo gdb /var/tmp/one.full/hurd/ext2fs.static
    [...]
    (gdb) attach 853
    Attaching to program `/var/tmp/one.full/hurd/ext2fs.static', pid 853
    warning: Can't modify tracing state for pid 853: No signal thread
    Can't fetch registers from thread 1: No such thread

(The _boot_ program [could be modified to print out the
pids](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?19254), so that one wouldn't have to fumble
with _ps_.)

W3

    $ sudo gdb /var/tmp/one.full/lib/ld.so.1
    [...]
    (gdb) set solib-absolute-prefix /var/tmp/one.full
    (gdb) attach 854
    Attaching to program `/var/tmp/one.full/lib/ld.so.1', pid 854
    warning: Can't modify tracing state for pid 854: No signal thread
    Can't fetch registers from thread 1: No such thread

W1

    [<Enter>.]
    /hurd/ext2fs.static --bootflags=-dsf --host-priv-port=38 --device-master-port=43 --exec-server-task=47 -Tdevice pseudo-root
    /lib/ld.so.1 /hurd/exec

Now that this step has been accomplished, you can set break points in GDB, etc.

W2

    (gdb) continue
    Continuing.
