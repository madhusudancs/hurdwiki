Sometimes it may already be helpful to capture a translator's `stdout` and
`stderr`, for example in this situation where [[translator/pfinet]] was
silently dying all the time, without any console output:

    $ sudo settrans -fgap ↩
      /servers/socket/2 ↩
      /bin/sh -c 'exec >> /root/pfinet.log 2>&1 && date && ↩
        /hurd/pfinet -i eth0 -a [...]'
    $ [...]
    $ cat /root/pfinet.log
    [date]
    NET4: Linux TCP/IP 1.0 for NET4.0
    IP Protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP
    TCP: Hash tables configured (ehash 65536 bhash 65536)
    pfinet: ../../hurd.work/pfinet/ethernet.c:196: ethernet_xmit: Unexpected error: (os/device) invalid IO size.

(Trying to run [[GDB]] in this case was of no help -- due to a bug in GDB
(supposedly) it wouldn't catch the fault.)

Be made aware that both `stdout` and `stderr` will be block bufferend and no
longer line buffered when doing such a redirection, so you'll have to arrange
for appropriate `fflush`es on these, or force them to be line buffered again
using the appropriate glibc magic (`setvbuf`).  Otherwise you'll see text in
the output files only if either glibc herself decides to flush (after some KiB
of text) the after translator exits.

There is also a [[related open issue|open_issues/translator_stdout_stderr]].
