Sometimes using [[GDB]] on a [[system_server|translator]] can result in a [[deadlock]].  You
can however still use GDB by using the [`set
noninvasive`](http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_19.html#Hurd%20Native)
option.  This indicates to GDB to not stop the program but allows you to
nevertheless examine its state.  Thus, you can get [[/gdb/backtrace]]s and values of
variables (and watch them change underneath you).
