IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-05-05, in context of libpthread conversion

    <braunr> ArneBab_: which also involved fixing libpthread to correctly
      handle timed waits and cancellation
    <braunr> although that part was done in january this year

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-05-10, in context of libpthread conversion

    <braunr> the "significant" changes i've done in libpthreads are actually
      related to io_select, for Q1 2013 :)

The **GNU Hurd** is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel.  It is a
collection of servers that run on the Mach microkernel to implement file
systems, network protocols, file access control, and other features that are
implemented by the Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).  [[More
detailed|hurd/documentation]].

**GNU Mach** is the microkernel upon which a GNU Hurd system is based.  It
provides an Inter Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that the Hurd uses to
define interfaces for implementing in a distributed multi-server fashion the
services a traditional operating system kernel provides.  [[More
detailed|microkernel/mach/gnumach]].
