In fact the lists *are* moderated for users that post from not-subscribed email
addresses.  However, this moderation should be transparent to the poster, you
only might notice some additional delay until your message shows up on the
list, as it has to be handled manually.  Note that this is a one-time delay, as
the address will be added to a white-list, so that further messages from the
same sending address will get through immediatelly.
The same holds for people who are sending their first message after subscribing
to a list.  These two measures greatly help to keep the lists' spam level low.

So, to initiate a discussion you do not need to subscribe to the mailing list
in question.  And people are very much encouraged to maintain the CC
recipients, so that you'll also receive replys to your message.
