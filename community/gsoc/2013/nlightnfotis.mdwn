# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-06-29

    <teythoon> so, how is your golang port going?
    <nlightnfotis> I just started working on it. I had been reading
      documentation so far. Maybe over reading as people told me when I asked
      for their feedback
    <nlightnfotis> but I will report on what I have done (technically tomorrow,
      and post it in the mailing list too.

    <nlightnfotis> Hey guys, what could possibly cause the following error
      message when executing a program in the Hurd? "./dumper: Could not open
      note: (system server) error with unknown subsystem"
    <nlightnfotis> My program is one that opens a file and dumps it into stdout
    <nlightnfotis> pinotree: the code I am using is the one present here
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hacking-guide/hhg.html under paragraph
      6.1
    <nlightnfotis> I investigated it a bit but can not find a lead. I seem to
      have all the rights to open the file that I want to dump to stdout
    <pinotree> what if you reset errno to 0 just after all the declarations in
      main, before the instructions?
    <nlightnfotis> will check this out and get back to you.
    <pinotree> sure :)
    <nlightnfotis> pinotree: Now it suggests that it can't get the number of
      readable files, which the source suggests that is normal behavior.
      Thanks for your assistance.


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-07-01

    <nlightnfotis> youpi: from my part I can report that I have started working
      with the code, and doing as Thomas suggested. I was about to write my
      report yesterday, but I am facing some build errors on the HURD, which I
      would like to investigate further before I write my report.
    <nlightnfotis> that's why I decided to write it later in the day.
    <youpi> I don't think you have to wait
    <youpi> you can simply write in your report that you are having build
      errors
    <nlightnfotis> ok. I will have it written and delivered later in the day.
    <nlightnfotis> braunr: that's cool. I think my reading has paid for
      itself. And you may be pleased to know that I have gotten my hands dirty
      with the code. I was about to write report yesterday, but some build
      errors with the gcc (that I am investigating atm) are holding me
      off. Will have that written later in the day.
    <braunr> don't hesitate to ask help about build errors
    <braunr> don't wait too much
    <braunr> you need to progress on what matters, and not be blocked by
      secondary problems
    <nlightnfotis> I will see myself asking for help rather sooner than later,
      but I would like to investigate it myself, and attempt to solve the
      issues that occur to me before resort to bugging you guys.
    <braunr> sure
    <braunr> just not too long
    <braunr> too long being a day or so
    <nlightnfotis> these were my build_results on the hurd
    <nlightnfotis> they were linker errors
    <nlightnfotis>
      https://gist.github.com/NlightNFotis/5896188#file-build_results
    <nlightnfotis> I am trying to build gcc on a linux 32 bit environment. It
      also has some issues but not linker errors
    <nlightnfotis> will resolve them to see if the linker errors are
      reproducible on linux
    <braunr> oh, lex stuff
    <braunr> should be easy enough


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-07-05

    <nlightnfotis> I have not made much progress, but I see myself working with
      it.
    <nlightnfotis> I have managed to build gcc go on Linux
    <nlightnfotis> but Hurd seems to have some issues
    <nlightnfotis> it seems to randomly crash
    <teythoon> the build process?
    <nlightnfotis> not quite randomly it seems to be though
    <nlightnfotis> yeah
    <nlightnfotis> I have noticed that there is a pattern
    <nlightnfotis> it does crash after some time
    <teythoon> ^^
    <nlightnfotis> but it doesn't crash at specific files
    <braunr> define crash
    <nlightnfotis> at some times it may crash during compiling insn-emit.c
    <braunr> (hello guys)
    <teythoon> hi braunr :)
    <nlightnfotis> braunr: hey there! It does seem to keep on compiling this
      file for a very long time (I have let it do so for 10, 20, 30 minutes)
      but the result is the same
    <nlightnfotis> and it does so for different files for different build
      options
    <braunr> ok so it doesn't crash
    <braunr> it just doesn't complete
    <braunr> is the virtual machine eating 100% cpu during that time ?
    <nlightnfotis> I can still type at the terminal, but I can't send a term
      signal
    <nlightnfotis> I can report that QEMU does hold 100% of one core at that
      time, (like it keeps processing) but there is no output on the terminal
    <braunr> ok
    <nlightnfotis> of course I can type at the terminal
    <nlightnfotis> but nothing happens
    <braunr> any idea of the size of the files involved ?
    <nlightnfotis> I am checking it out right now
    <nlightnfotis> before this goes any further, let me report on my
      investigation
    <braunr> i expect that to be our classic writeback thread storm issue
    <nlightnfotis> initially, I thought it might be that it run out of memory
    <nlightnfotis> even though I know that compilation is not memory intensive,
      rather, cpu intensive
    <nlightnfotis> anyway I increased the size of ram available to the vm
    <nlightnfotis> from 1024 mb to 1536
    <nlightnfotis> that didn't seem to have any effect. The "crash" still
      happens at the same time, at the same files
    <braunr> use freeze
    <braunr> not crash
    <braunr> crash is very misleading here
    <nlightnfotis> freeze it is then.
    <nlightnfotis> anyway
    <nlightnfotis> then it striked me that it might be that the hard disk size
      (3gb) might be too small (considering the gcc git repo is 1gb+)
    <nlightnfotis> so I resized the qemu image to 8gb of hdd size
    <nlightnfotis> the new size is acknowledged by the vm
    <pinotree> for gcc in debug mode? might still not be enough
    <nlightnfotis> but still it has no effect - it seems to follow its freezing
      patterns
    <pinotree> giving your work, i'd have not less than 15-20
    <braunr> i'd use 32
    <pinotree> *given
    <braunr> but that's because i like power of twos
    <nlightnfotis> pinotree: thanks for the advice. Right now I was gonna
      increase the swap size
    <nlightnfotis> according to vmstat in the hurd
    <nlightnfotis> swap size is 173 mb
    <nlightnfotis> don't know if it does have an impact
    <braunr> it may but before rushing
    <braunr> if you need swap, you're doomed anyway
    <braunr> consider swap highly unreliable on the hurd
    <braunr> please show the output of df -h on the file system you're using to
      build
    <braunr> ideally, i'd recommend using separate / and /home file systems
    <braunr> it really improves reliability
    <nlightnfotis> I don't think it swaps to be honest; however that's
      something that my mentor thomas had suggested (increasing swap size) so I
      am gonna try it at some time.
    <pinotree> or have a separate file system in a subdi and work on it
    <braunr> yes, /home or whatever suits you
    <braunr> just not /
    <nlightnfotis> braunr: pinotree: thanks both for your advice. Will do now,
      and report on the results.
    <braunr> that's not all
    <braunr> 11:17 < braunr> please show the output of df -h on the file system
      you're using to build
    <nlightnfotis> braunr: I am on it. Oh and btw, everytime I am forced to
      close the vm (due to the freezes) when I restart it ext2 reports that the
      file system was not cleanly unmounted and does some repair to some
      files. I am trying to find an explanation for that, but I can think of
      many things
    <braunr> well obviously
    <pinotree> ext2 has no journaling
    <braunr> the file system was not cleanly unmounted since you restarted it
      with a cold reset
    <nlightnfotis> braunr: df -h comes out with this: "df: cannot read table of
      mounted file systems"
    <pinotree> also, even if you manage to always shut down correctly, when
      fsck runs because of the maximum mount count it'd find errors anyway (so
      we have some bug)
    <braunr> nlightnfotis: df -h /path/to/build/dir
    <braunr> pinotree: not really bugs but it could be cleaned up
    <nlightnfotis> filesystem: - Size 2.8G Used 2.8G Avail 0 Use% 100% Mounted
      on /
    <nlightnfotis> wow
    <braunr> nlightnfotis: see
    <nlightnfotis> that seems to explain many things
    <teythoon> ^^
    <nlightnfotis> thanks for that braunr!
    <braunr> you resized the disk, but not the partition and the file system
    <pinotree> braunr: well, if something in ext2 (or its libs) leaves issues
      in the fs, i'd call that a bug :>
    <nlightnfotis> yeah, that was utterly stupid of me
    <braunr> pinotree: they're not issues
    <braunr> nlightnfotis: be careful, mach needs a reboot every time you
      change a partition table
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: important thing is that you found the issue :)
    <braunr> then only, you can use resize2fs
    <teythoon> braunr: weird, I thought mach nowadays can reload the partition
      tables?
    <teythoon> braunr: doesn't d-i need that?
    <braunr> maybe a recent change i forgot
    <braunr> or maybe fdisk still reports the error although it's fine
    <braunr> in doubt, rebooting is still safe :p
    <teythoon> or maybe youpi hacked it into d-is gnumach
    <braunr> i doubt it would be there for the installer only :)
    <braunr> if it's there, it's there
    <braunr> i just don't know it
    <nlightnfotis> braunr: teythoon: and everyone else that helped me. Thanks
      you all guys. This was something that was driving me crazy. Will do all
      that you suggested and report back on my status


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-07-08

    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge, I have managed to overcome most of the obstacles
      I had initially faced with my project
    <nlightnfotis> but I still had some build errors, that's why I have not
      reported yet. Wanna try to see if I can resolve them today, and write my
      report in the afternoon.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: So, from a quick look into the IRC backlog, it
      was a "simple" out of disk space problem?  %-)  That happens.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: And yes, GCC needs a lot of disk space.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: What kind of build errors are you seeing now?
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge, yeah I felt stupid at the time, but it didn't
      actually strike me that the file system didn't see the extra space. Also
      it took me some time to figure out that in order to mount the new
      partition, I only had to edit /etc/fstab
    <nlightnfotis> always tried to mount it with the ext2 translator
    <nlightnfotis> and the translator kept dying
    <nlightnfotis> but it's all figured out now
    <nlightnfotis> the latest build errors I am seeing are these
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: o_O you used fstab and it worked?
    <nlightnfotis> yeah
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: that's unexpected from my perspective...
    <nlightnfotis> I only had to add the new partition into fstab
    <nlightnfotis> teythoon: I can pastebin my fstab if you wanna take a look
      at it
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: these were my latest build errors
      https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0pssdnfa22ajbp/build_results
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: I'm pretty sure that mount -a isn't done on hurd
      w/o pinos runsystem.sysv
    <teythoon> weird
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: I have also tried to build gcc with "make -w"
      which from what I know supresses the errors that stopped compilation
    <nlightnfotis> but the weird thing is that gcc nearly took forever to build
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: could you do a showtrans /your/mountpoint?
    <nlightnfotis> teythoon: /hurd/ext2fs /dev/hd0s3
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: ok, so you've set a passive translator and an
      active is started on demand
    <nlightnfotis> it must be a passive translator
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: this is the hurd way of doing things, fstab is
      unrelated
    <nlightnfotis> it seems to persist during reboots
    <teythoon> yes, exactly
    <nlightnfotis> teythoon: my fstab if you wanna take a look
      http://pastebin.com/ef94JPhG
    <nlightnfotis> after I added /dev/hd0s3 to fstab along with its mountpoint,
      and restarting the hurd, only then I did manage to use that partition
    <nlightnfotis> before doing so I tried pretty much anything involving
      mounting the partition and setting the ext2fs translator for it, but it
      kept dying
    <nlightnfotis> of course it was a ext2 filesystem
    <youpi> err, perhaps adding to fstab simply triggered an fsck at reboot?
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: might have been that you needed to reboot mach so
      that it picks up the new partition table
    <teythoon> youpi: I thought this was fixed, the partition reloading I mean?
    <youpi> that is needed, yes
    <youpi> let me check
    <nlightnfotis> youpi: it could be, though, to be honest, my hurd system
      does an fsck all the time at boot
    <teythoon> how do you manage to do that w/o rebooting for d-i?
    <youpi> (I don't remember whether device busy is detected)
    <youpi> teythoon: by making all translators go away, iirc
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: btw, you have ~/gcc_new as mountpoint in your
      fstab, pretty sure that this cannot work, the path has to be absolute and
      no ~ expansion is done
    <nlightnfotis> tbh it does work, and it's weird
    <teythoon> nlightnfotis: it works b/c of the passive translator you set,
      not b/c of the fstab entry
    <nlightnfotis> teythoon: should I change it?
    <teythoon> probably, yes
    <tschwinge> Well, that is probably not used anywhere.
    <teythoon> tschwinge: not yet but soon ;)
    <tschwinge> Isn't /etc/fstab only consulted for fsck.
    <youpi> atm yes
    <tschwinge> Anyway, it is definitely a very good idea to have a partition
      separate from the rootfs for doing actual work.
    <tschwinge> I think I described that in one of the first GSoC coodridation
      emails.  In the long one.
    <nlightnfotis> teythoon: Oh it struck me now! Is it because tilde expansion
      is only happening in bash, but /etc/fstab is read before bash is
      initialized?
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Instead of fumbling around with partitioning of
      disk images, it may be easier in your KVM/QEMU setup to simply add a new
      disk using -hdb [file] (or similar).
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Basically, yes.
    <youpi> nlightnfotis: fstab is not related with bash in any way
    <nlightnfotis> anyway, it shouldn't matter now, it seems to be working, and
      I wouldn't like fiddling around with it and messing it up now. I will
      continue with resolving the gcc issues.
    <tschwinge> But /etc/fstab has its very own "language" (layout), so tilde
      expansion will never be done there.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: df -h ~/gcc_new/
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: size 24G Used: 4.2G Avail 18G
    <tschwinge> OK, that's fine.
    <tschwinge> As you can see on
      <http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/open_issues/gcc/#index4h1>, GCC
      will easily need some GiB.
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: I have some questions about GCC: out of curiosity
      how much time does it take to compile it on your machine? Because
      yesterday I tried a -w (suppress warnings) build and it seemed to take
      forever
    <nlightnfotis> mind you the vm has 1536 ram available (I have read
      somewhere that it can utilise such an amount) and the vm is KVM enabled
    <youpi> without disabling g++, it can easily take hours
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: The build error is unexpected, because I had
      addressed that issue in a recent patch.  :-)
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: This is wrong: »checking whether setcontext
      clobbers TLS variables... [...] yes«.  Please check your sources, that
      they correspond to the current version of the upstream
      tschwinge/t/hurd/go branch.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Quoting from that wiki page: »This takes up
      around 3.5 GiB, and needs roughly 3.5 h on kepler.SCHWINGE and 15 h on
      coulomb.SCHWINGE.«  The latter is my Hurd machine.
    <tschwinge> That's however with Java and Ada enabled, and a full
      three-stages bootstrap.
    <youpi> ah, right, there's java & ada too
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: git branch (in the repo): master,
      *tschwinge/t/hurd/go
    <youpi> in debian they are built separately
    <tschwinge> What I asked you to do is configure »--disable-bootstrap
      --enable-languages=go«.
    <tschwinge> So that should be a lot quicker.
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: oh yes, everytime I have tried to compile gcc I
      have done with these configurations
    <tschwinge> But still a few hours perhaps.
    <nlightnfotis> that's what I did yesterday too.
    <tschwinge> OK, good.  :-)
    <tschwinge> A bootstrap build is a good way to check the just-built GCC for
      sanity, but we expect that it is fine, as we concentrate on the GCC Go
      port.
    <nlightnfotis> the only "extra" configuration yesterday was my "-w" flag to
      make, because those errors were actually triggered by -Werror
    <tschwinge> Let me read up what make -w does.  ;-)
    <nlightnfotis> ah, yes, d/w I have read and understood what the bootstrap
      build is. Seems like we don't need it atm
    <nlightnfotis> afaik it suppresses all warnings
    <pinotree> youpi: gcj no more
    <nlightnfotis> the way gcc builds, it does convert (some) warnings to
      errors
    <tschwinge> Hmm.  -w, --print-directory Print a message containing the
      working directory before and after other processing.
    <pinotree> youpi: doko folded gcj and gdc into gcc-4.8 to "workaround"
      Built-Using
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Ah, that'S configure --enable-werror or something
      like that.
    <youpi> pinotree: right
    <nlightnfotis> yep, and -w suppresses it
    <nlightnfotis> (from what I have understood)
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Are you thinking about make -k?
    <tschwinge> Yeah, I guess.
    <nlightnfotis> let me see what -k does
    <pinotree> youpi: (just to make builds even more lightweight, eh</irony>)
    <nlightnfotis> yeah, -k should do too, I shall try it
    <tschwinge> But: if gcc -Werror fails, even with make -k, the build will
      not be able to come to a successful end, because that one complation
      artefact that failed will be missing.
    <nlightnfotis> so I shall try again with -w (supressed warnings)
    <tschwinge> Configureing with --disable-werror (or similar) will "help" if
      -Werror is the default, and the build fails due to that.
    <nlightnfotis> from what I have understood these "errors" are not something
      critical: it's only that function prototypes for these functions are
      missing
    <nlightnfotis> I have seen the code there, and even "default" gcc generated
      prototypes (from the first usage of the function) should do, so I can't
      understand why it might be a serious problem if I tell gcc to skip that
      point
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Ah, now I see.  You don't mean make -w, but
      rather gcc -w: »-w  Inhibit all warning messages.«
    <tschwinge> But really, there shouldn't be such warnings/errors that make
      the build fail.
    <nlightnfotis> yeah
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: In your GCC sources directory, what does this
      tell: git rev-parse HEAD
    <tschwinge> And, is the checkout clean: git status
    <tschwinge> The latter will take some time.
    <nlightnfotis> git status takes an awful amount of time
    <nlightnfotis> last I checked
    <nlightnfotis> but git rev-parse HEAD
    <nlightnfotis> produces this result:
    <nlightnfotis> 91840dfb3942a8d241cc4f0e573e5a9956011532
    <tschwinge> OK, that's correct.  So probably some of the checked out files
      are not in a pristine state?
    <nlightnfotis> I shall run a git clean and see. If that doesn't work too,
      maybe I shall reclone the repository?
    <nlightnfotis> there's nothing foreign to the repo that I have added, only
      lib gmp, lib mpc and lib mpfr (and they are in their own folders inside
      my gcc working directory)
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: You shouldn't need to do the latter if you
      instead run: apt-get build-dep gcc-4.8
    <nlightnfotis> I remember having done that inside the Hurd, but it always
      resulted in an error from what I can recall
    <nlightnfotis> let me check this out
    <nlightnfotis> yes
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Whenever you use Git on Hurd, pass the --quiet
      flag, to avoid the rare but possible corruption issue described on
      <http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/open_issues/git_duplicated_content/>
      and <http://darnassus.sceen.net/~hurd-web/open_issues/git-core-2/>.
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: Forgive me for that. I will set up an alias
      immediately.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: I don't know if an alias is possible, because --
      I think -- you'll need to do things like: git fetch --quiet
    <tschwinge> So pass --quiet to subcommands.
    <nlightnfotis> oh. ok.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: What you can also do, is shut down your Hurd VM,
      and mount the disk image on GNU/Linux (mount with offset to get the right
      partition), and then run a diff -ru against a Git clone done on
      GNU/Linux, and see whether there are any unexpected differences outside
      of the .git/ directory.
    <nlightnfotis> sounds like a plan. I will check this out today then :)
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: if all else fails, then recloning the repo with
      --quiet passed should work, right?
    <tschwinge> Yes, that's probably the most straight-forward check to do.
    <tschwinge> Heh, yes to both these questions.  :-)
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: Oh, you don't even have to re-clone, but rather
      re-check-out the branch.
    <nlightnfotis> I was thinking of recloning just to bring the whole
      repository to a pristine state
    <tschwinge> So something like (inside the source directory): rm -rf ./*
      (remove any files, but leave .* in place, in particular the .git/
      directory), followd by git checkout -f HEAD --quiet
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: But before doing that, please do the diff first,
      so that we know (hopefully) where the erroneous build results were coming
      from.
    <nlightnfotis> considering the Copyright assignment files, I have sent them
      from day 1 (that is the 20th of June). I have not heard anything about
      those documents to date (sadly)
    <nlightnfotis> what's worst is that although I have a reference number to
      track those documents, their (greek postal office) tracking service sucks
      so badly, that one day it's offline, the next it suggests it can't find
      the object in their database, the next it says it is still in the local
      post office
    <nlightnfotis> let me check it out now
    <nlightnfotis> still nothing from their online service
    <nlightnfotis> let me call them
    <nlightnfotis> tschwinge: I called the post office regarding the copyright
      papers. They told me that the same day (the 20th of June) it left from
      Herakleion, Crete to Athens and the same day it must have left the
      country heading towards the US. They also told me it takes about 1 week
      for it to arrive.
    <tschwinge> nlightnfotis: OK, so probably waiting at the FSF office to be
      processed.  Let's allow for some more time.  After all, this is not
      critical for your progress.
