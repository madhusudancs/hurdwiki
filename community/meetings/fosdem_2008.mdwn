Samuel booked rooms at The Moon Hotel, Rue de la Montagne 4B

- one triple room for the night of Thirsday 21
- two double rooms and two triple rooms for the nights of Friday 22, Saturday 23 and Sunday 24.
(these were the last rooms of the hotel)

i.e. 3+10*3 nights for a total cost of 1104&euro;, which makes 33.5&euro;/night.

in each room there is a double bed, so some people will have to be "couples".

Breakfast is included, there is hotspot wifi

check-in can be between 13:00 and 00:00, departure is before 11:00

i.e including sdschulze, who hereby confirms
-->

We need someone to get the keys before
20:00. Reservations last until 16:00, so either he gets the keys before 16:00,
or we just need to call for confirming the reservation

[[I|tschwinge]] seem to remember something that in 2007 the Madame at the
reception wasn't really happy with us arriving later than 16:00 even with
having had confirmed that via a phone call.
