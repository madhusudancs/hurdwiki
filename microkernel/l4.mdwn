The [*L4* microkernel](http://l4ka.org/) is an attempt to create a very small
high performace core which provides basic memory management, task and context
switching, and little else.

[L4Ka Pistachio Home](http://l4ka.org/projects/pistachio/).

See [l4.verified](http://nicta.com.au/research/projects/l4.verified) for work
on formally verifying an L4 microkernel.

There was a GNU/Hurd [[port to L4|history/port_to_another_microkernel]], which
is now stalled.

    <mcsim> If someone interested, there is a channel with lectures about
      Genode and L4: http://www.youtube.com/user/drsartakov?feature=watch

    < Spyro> also
    < Spyro> what's the basic difference between mach and L4?
    < braunr> l4 is a nanokernel whereas mach is a hybrid with high level
      messaging and virtual memory services
