Read about the [[general concept of a *remote procedure call* (RPC)|/rpc]].

Uses Mach's [[IPC]] [[mechanism]].

The [[port]] abstraction allows RPCs to be executed on another computer
transparently.  This can be implemented with user [[task]]s, but there is an
implementation in the kernel possible, too, which is called *NORMA*, but is not
avilable in [[GNU Mach|gnumach]].

The RPC stub code is generated by [[MIG]] to send appropriate [[message]]s.
