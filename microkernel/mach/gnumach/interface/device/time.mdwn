The *mapped-time interface*, that is, a `mmap`able read-only memory page
containing a `struct mapped_time_value`.  See the [[reference_manual]].

Typically available as `/dev/time`, [[hurd/translator/storeio]].

Using that, [[hurd/libshouldbeinlibc]]'s `<maptime.h>` provides `maptime_map`
and `maptime_read`, see the [[hurd/reference_manual]].  Candidate for
replacement with [[open_issues/vDSO]] code?

    <teythoon> braunr: about the mach device interface, if i open a device, and
      then create a memory mapping using device_map, does that increment the
      open count of the device ?
    <teythoon> can i call device_close w/o destroying the mapping directly
      after mapping it ?
    <antrik> teythoon: I have a vague recollection that the mapping (or more
      precisely, the memory object) is not bound to the open once
      established... but don't take my word on it -- it's been some years since
      I played with that stuff :-)
    <teythoon> antrik: yes, that would actually match my expectation
    <braunr> hum
    <braunr> normally, mapping increments the usage count of the resource
      mapped, but not the open count
    <braunr> i don't know if that's the case for mach devices
    <braunr> teythoon: which mach device btw ?
    <teythoon> time
    <teythoon> libshouldbeinlibc/maptime.c line ~53
    <teythoon> the device is opened but never closed
    <braunr> is that a problem ?
    <teythoon> not sure, but I'd think so, yes
    <braunr> why ?
    <teythoon> the open count is incremented each time
    <braunr> at map time ?
    <braunr> ah no, since that's your question
    <braunr> the open count is normally decremented when the send right for the
      device is destroyed, which occurs when tasks exit
    <teythoon> hm
    <teythoon> but wouldn't only important long running servers use the mach
      device ?
    <braunr> all tasks do
    <braunr> a simple call to gettimeofday will use it
    <teythoon> well, but only privileged processes may get teh device master
      port
    <braunr> the device is probably accessible through some other method
    <teythoon> yes. /dev/time
    <teythoon> err, have you looked at the function ? ;)
    <braunr> no
    <braunr> which one ?
    <teythoon> maptime_map
    <braunr> i did once but quickly
    <teythoon> if use_mach_dev, the mach device is used, /dev/time otherwise
    <braunr> gettimeofday apparently uses __host_get_time
    <braunr> mhmm
    <braunr> ok so i was wrong
    <braunr> the time device, whether it is the mach or the hurd one, seems to
      be mapped only by translators
    <braunr> 14:10 < teythoon> but wouldn't only important long running servers
      use the mach device ?
    <braunr> so yes :)
    <teythoon> so we should close the device
    <braunr> why ?
    <teythoon> to prevent an overflow in the open count
    <braunr> when is it open multiple times ?
    <teythoon> isn't it ? maybe /me lacks some context ;)
    <braunr> it's called once at init time
    <teythoon> well, ok then
    <braunr> gettimeofday-like functions then only read the mapped memory
    <braunr> at least, that's how it's done in the servers i've looked at such
      as pfinet
    <teythoon> makes sense, yes
    <braunr> something i learnt from experience and failures: check the problem
      actually exists before fixing it :p
    <teythoon> well, if the memory mapping is independent of the device, then
      there is a problem
    <teythoon> the device is kept open for no reason
    <braunr> teythoon: if you can determine that the device doesn't need to
      stay open for the mapping to remain, then you can close it
    <braunr> otherwise, it's such a minor leak that we don't care at all
    <braunr> i wouldn't even consider it a leak more than a small static
      variable used at init time only
    <teythoon> looks like, yes
    <teythoon> also, it's only in the rootfs translator
    <braunr> ?
    <teythoon> only the root filesystem uses the mach device directly
    <braunr> ok
    <braunr> well, /dev/time too right ?
    <teythoon> yes, but that is a storeio translator that does not use this
      code
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> hm
    <teythoon> only the root filesystem uses the mach device directly *using
      this function*
