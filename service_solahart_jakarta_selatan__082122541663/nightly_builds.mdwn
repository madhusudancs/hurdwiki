We'd like to have nightly builds for the whole [[toolchain]], and then do some
automatic [[unit_testing]] on them.

  * As reported in the [[news/2010-05-31]] news, there's Hydra doing nightly
    builds / Nix packages.

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-11-15:

        <teythoon> today I discovered buildbot, and both the master as well as
          the build slave works just fine out of the box on Hurd :)
        <teythoon> I'd love to set one up on darnassus
        <braunr> ah nice
        <braunr> we use buildbot at work too
        <teythoon> even better, so you already know it
        <braunr> sure we can
        <braunr> no i don't
        <braunr> i just know we use it :)
        <teythoon> k
        <braunr> but that would be a good occasion to learn
        <braunr> i'm a bit busy right now, have to go soon
        <braunr> we'll see the details later
        <teythoon> yes :)
