# `sudo`

`sudo [task]` hands after finishing `[task]`.

    <youpi> the sudo bug is select() not being able to get interrupted by
      signals


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-01-05

In context of [[alarm_setitimer]].

    <youpi> it's a know issue in select
    <youpi> it's not interruptible by a SIGALRM for instance
    <youpi> which is what ntpdate uses
    <youpi> when __io_select is used, it *is* interruptible
    <youpi> but when __mach_msg is used, it is *not* interruptible
    <youpi> it happens that by luck, ntpdate uses just one fd, and thus it's
      __io_select which is used, and thus it gets an interruption after 1s
      (instead of after 60s, the timeout)
    <youpi> with braunr's patch, it's __mach_msg which is used to wait, and
      thus the interruption doesn't happen, and we have to wait  60s, the
      timeout...
    <youpi> so braunr's patch is still correct, it's the __mach_msg call which
      we do need to make interruptible (it was already on the todolist)

Proposed patch: [[!message-id
"20130105162817.GW5965@type.youpi.perso.aquilenet.fr"]].

    <_d3f> Hello, any one else having problems with git?
    <braunr> _d3f: yes
    <braunr> _d3f: it will be fixed in the next glibc release
    <_d3f> oh thx. what was the problem?
    <braunr> http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2013-01/msg00005.html
    <WhiteKIBA> exactly this problem is preventing us building glibc
    <braunr> it's indeed very annoying
    <braunr> and this fix will probably have a visible and positive effect on
      other issues
    <_d3f> let's hope so. 
    <braunr> well, i'm already using it and see the difference
