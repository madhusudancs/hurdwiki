    <kilobug> init=/bin/sh hack doesn't work for GNU/Hurd ?
    <antrik> kilobug: I don't think you can override init on Hurd. the init
      server is actually involved in bootstrapping part of the system core
    <antrik> at some point we discussed the possibility to reduce the Hurd init
      server to *only* do that, and then pass on to standard sysv init... with
      that it could actually work


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-11-29

    <teythoon> we need to make the bootstrap code more robust and fix the error
      handling there
    <teythoon> for example, you can kill the exec server and the rootfs w/o
      /hurd/init noticing it...
    <braunr> yes
    <teythoon> there are plans in init.c to take over the exception port of the
      essential processes
    <teythoon> that could help
