    <afleck> what is the use of having a port set name that can receive from
      multiple ports?
    <youpi> think of select()
    <afleck> I haven't really gotten into it yet, I was just reading the Mach
      Kernel Guide and I didn't understand the difference between having a port
      set and multiple ports, since you can't choose which port receives in a
      port set.
    <youpi> with multiple ports, you'd have to have as many threads to block in
      reception
    <youpi> or poll in turn
