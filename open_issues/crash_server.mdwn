Given an `a.out` executable that only does `raise (SIGABRT)`, invoking that
one...

  * ... against `crash-dump-core` will...

      * ... not overwrite existing `core` files.

        Is this reasonable?  Linux does overwrite them, for example.

      * ... show big variances in running-time behavior:

# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-07

    <rekado> I'm trying to investigate a crash in pfinet, so it will actually
      die.  I just want to know why it dies and what the value of a few
      variables has been when it died.
    <teythoon> have you tried to make it dump core?
    <rekado> oh, good idea.
    <rekado> I'll try that.
    <teythoon> do you know how?
    <rekado> I don't, but I think I can figure it out.
    <teythoon> look into /servers
    <rekado> do I just have to set CRASHSERVER=/servers/crash-dump-core and run
      pfinet in that environment?
    <teythoon> possibly, I've never heard of CRASHSERVER, but it's certainly
      plausible ;)
    <teythoon> I just link crash to crash-dump-core, that way it is permanent
      and for all processes
    <rekado> found it in the website contents
    <rekado> gotta try that.
    <rekado> hmm, I can't get pfinet to dump core; linked /servers/crash to
      /servers/crash-dump-core and compiled pfinet to raise(6) at one point.
    <rekado> But no core file is created.
    <teythoon> :/
    <teythoon> rekado: try cd /tmp ; cat & kill -SIGILL %% to see if that dumps
      core
    <rekado> yes, this works.
    <rekado> I replaced the original pfinet with my crashing version.
    <rekado> Should it dump core to /hurd then?
    <teythoon> I'm not sure about it's wd
    <teythoon> hm, ok, I just did settrans -ca foo /hurd/pfinet and then killed
      that pfient with SIGILL and it dumped core
    <teythoon> to the directory I issued the settrans from
    <rekado> So I must run it myself.  I can't just replace the original binary
      and have it dump core somewhere.
    <teythoon> it seems that you have to use settrans -ca to start an active
      translator
    <teythoon> do fsysopts /servers/socket/2 to find out the cmdline of your
      pfinet
    <rekado> that's very helpful.
    <rekado> thanks
    <teythoon> then use this to restart it, e.g.:
    <teythoon> settrans -afg /servers/socket/2 $(fsysopts /servers/socket/2)
    <teythoon> if it dies it should dump core to you cwd
    <rekado> great. Thank you very much.  I had been wondering how to get the
      full cmdline of pfinet.
    * rekado makes a note of fsysopts
    <rekado> yup, there's the core file. Nice.
    <teythoon> cool 8D
    <teythoon> btw, in case using gdb doesn't work out for your problem, if you
      start pfinet (or any translator) this way (with -a == active), you can
      write stuff to stderr
    <rekado> yeah, I noticed that.  The assert() call wrote to stderr.  Useful.
    <braunr> rekado: core dumps are another not-working-well feature of the
      hurd :/
    <braunr> i recommend attaching
    <tschwinge> rekado: In case that's still helpful:
      <http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/debugging/translator.html>.


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-12-14

    <gnu_srs> How to get a core dump?
    <teythoon> either set CRASHSERVER to /servers/crash-dump-core for the
      process you want the core file of
    <teythoon> or make /servers/crash point to crash-dump-core to make this the
      default for all processes
    <gnu_srs> does it work now, it did not before?
    <teythoon> it does for me, never had issues
    <gnu_srs> k!
    <teythoon> well, i believe the second option has issues
    <teythoon> if two processes crash, both may write/create a file in the same
      location
