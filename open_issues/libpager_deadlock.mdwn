    <braunr> ah great, a paper about the mach pageout daemon !
    <mcsim> braunr: Where is paper about the mach pageout daemon?
    <braunr> ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/project/mach/doc/published/defaultmm.ps
    <braunr> might give us a clue about the swap deadlock (although i still
      have a few ideas to check)
    <braunr>
      http://www.sceen.net/~rbraun/moving_the_default_memory_manager_out_of_the_mach_kernel.pdf
    <braunr> we should more seriously consider sergio's advisory pageout branch
      some day

[[user/Sergio_Lopez]], [[gnumach_memory_management_2]].

    <braunr> i'll try to get in touch with him about that before he completely
      looses interest
    <braunr> i'll include it in my "make that page cache as decent as possible"
      task
    <braunr> many of his comments match what i've seen
    <braunr> and we both did a few optimizations the same way
    <braunr> (like not deactivating pages when they enter the cache)

    <braunr> antrik: i'm able to consistently reproduce the swap deadlocks you
      regularly had when using apt with my page cache patch
    <braunr> it happens when lots of dirty pages are write back to their pagers
    <braunr> so apt, or a big file copy or anything that writes several MiB
      very quickly is a good candidate
    <braunr> written*
    <antrik> braunr: nice...
    <braunr> antrik: well in a way, yes, as it will allow us to track it more
      easily

    <braunr> oh btw, i think i can say with confidence that the hurd *doesn't*
      deadlock
    <braunr> (at least, concerning swapping)
    <braunr> lol, one of my hurd systems has been hitting the "swap deadlock"
      for more than an hour, and suddenly got out of it
    <braunr> something is really wrong in the pageout daemon, but it's not a
      deadlock
    <youpi> a livelock then
    <braunr> do you get out of livelocks ?
    <braunr> i mean, it's not even a "lock"
    <braunr> just a big damn tricky slowdown 
    <youpi> yes, you can, by giving a few more resources for instance
    <youpi> depends on the kind of livelock of course
    <braunr> i think it's that
    <braunr> the pageout daemon clearly throttles itself, waiting for pagers to
      complete
    <braunr> and another dangerous thing is the line in vm_resident, which only
      wakes on thread to avoid starvation
    <braunr> hum, during the livelock, the kernel spends much time waiting in
      db_read_address
    <braunr> could be a bad stack
    <braunr> so, the pageout daemon seems to slow itself as much as waiting
      several seconds between each iteration when under load
    <braunr> but each iteration possibly removes clean pages
    <braunr> so at some point, there is enough memory to unblock waiting pagers
    <braunr> for now i'll try a simple solution, like limiting the pausing
      delay
    <braunr> but we'll need more page lists in the future (inactive-clean,
      inactive-dirty, etc..)
    <braunr> limiting the amount of dirty pages is the only way to really make
      it safe actually
    <braunr> wow, the pageout loop is still running even after many pages were
      freed, and it unable to free more pages
    <braunr> i think i have an idea about the livelock
    <braunr> i think it comes from the periodic syncing
    <bddebian> Too often?
    <braunr> that's not the problem
    <braunr> the problem is that it can happen at the same time with paging
    <bddebian> Oh
    <braunr> if paging gets slow, it won't stop the periodic syncing
    <braunr> which will grab any page it can as soon as some are free
    <braunr> but then, before it even finishes, another sync may occur
    <braunr> i have yet to check that it is possible
    <braunr> and i don't understand why syncing isn't done by the kernel
    <braunr> the kernel is supposed to handle the paging policy
    <braunr> and it would make paging really scale
    <bddebian> It's done on the Hurd side?
    <braunr> (instead of having external pagers make one request for each
      object, even if they're clean)
    <braunr> yes
    <bddebian> Hmm, interesting
    <braunr> ofc, with ext2fs --debug, i can't reproduce anything
    <bddebian> Ugh
    <braunr> sync are serialized
    <braunr> grmbl
    <braunr> there is a big lock taken at sync time though
    <braunr> uhg


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-16

    <braunr> all right so, there *is* a deadlock, and it may be due to the
      default pager actually
    <braunr> the vm_page_laundry_count doesn't decrease at some point, even
      when there are more than enough free pages
    <braunr> antrik: the thing is, i think the deadlock concerns the default
      pager
    <antrik> the deadlock?
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> when swapping


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-17

    <braunr> i can't even reproduce the swap deadlock when using upstrea ext2fs
      :(
    <braunr> upstream*


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-19

    <braunr> the libpager deadlock patch looks wrong to me
    <braunr> hm no, the libpager patch is ok acually


## [[synchronous_ipc]]

### IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-20

    <braunr> but actually after reviewing more, the debian patch for this
      particular issue seems correct
    <antrik> well, it's most probably done by youpi, so I would be shocked if
      it wasn't correct... ;-)
    <braunr> he wasn't sure at all about it
    <antrik> still ;-)
    <braunr> :)
    <antrik> well, if you also think it's correct, I guess it's time to push it
      upstream...


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-23

    <braunr> i still can't conclude if we have any pageout deadlock, or if it's
      simply a side effect of the active and inactive lists getting very very
      large
    <braunr> but almost every time this issue happens, it somehow recovers,
      sometimes hours later
