In the topic of *code analysis* or *program analysis* ([[!wikipedia
Program_analysis_(computer_science) desc="Wikipedia article"]]), there is
static code analysis ([[!wikipedia Static_code_analysis desc="Wikipedia
article"]]) and dynamic program analysis ([[!wikipedia Dynamic_program_analysis
desc="Wikipedia article"]]).  This topic overlaps with [[performance
analysis|performance]], [[formal_verification]], as well as general
[[debugging]].

There is a [[!FF_project 276]][[!tag bounty]] on some of these tasks.


# Static

  * [[GCC]]'s warnings.  Yes, really.

      * GCC plugins can be used for additional semantic analysis.  For example,
        <http://lwn.net/Articles/457543/>, and search for *kernel context* in
        the comments.

      * Have GCC make use of [[RPC]]/[[microkernel/mach/MIG]] *in*/*out*
        specifiers, and have it emit useful warnings in case these are pointing
        to uninitialized data (for *in* only).

        <teythoon> btw, I've been looking at http://frama-c.com/ lately
        <teythoon> it's a theorem prover for c/c++
        <braunr> oh nice
        <teythoon> I think it's most impressive, it works on the hurd (aptitude
          install frama-c o_O)
        <teythoon> *and it works
        <braunr> "Simple things should be simple,
        <braunr> complex things should be possible."
        <braunr> :)
        <braunr> looks great
        <teythoon> even the gui is awesome, allows one to browse source code in
          a very impressive way
        <braunr> clear separation between value changes, dependencies, side
          effects
        <braunr> we could have plugins for stuff like ports
        <braunr> handles concurrency oO
        <nalaginrut> so you want to use Frame-C to analyze the whole Hurd code
          base?
        <teythoon> nalaginrut: well, frama-c looks "able" to assist in
          analyzing the Hurd, yes
        <teythoon> nalaginrut: but theorem proving is a manual process, one
          needs to guide the prover
        <teythoon> nalaginrut: b/c some stuff is not decideable
        <nalaginrut> I ask this because I can imagine how to analyze Linux
          since all the code is in a directory. But Hurd's codes are
          distributed to many other projects
        <braunr> that's not a problem
        <braunr> each server can be analyzed separately
        <teythoon> braunr: also, each "entry point"
        <nalaginrut> alright, but sounds a big work
        <teythoon> it is
        <braunr> otherwise, formal verification would be widespread :)
        <teythoon> that, and most tools are horrible to use, frama-c is really
          an exception in this regard

            <pere> btw, did you consider adding hurd and mach to <URL:
              https://scan.coverity.com/ > to detect bugs automatically?
            <pere> I found lots of bugs in gnash, ipmitool and sysvinit when I
              started scanning those projects. :)
            <teythoon> i did some static analysis work, i haven't used coverty
              but free tools for that
            <teythoon> i think thomas wanted to look into coverty though
            <pere> quite easy to set up, but you need to download and run a
              non-free tarball on the build host.
            <teythoon> does that tar ball contains binary code ?
            <teythoon> that'd be a show stopper for the hurd of course
            <pere> did not investigate.  I just put it in a contained virtual
              machine.
            <pere> did not want it on my laptop. :)
            <pere> prefer free software here. :)
            <pere> but I did not have to "accept license", at least. :)

            <mcsim> seems I made it work


## Hurd-specific Applications

  * [[Port Sequence Numbers|microkernel/mach/ipc/sequence_numbering]].  If
    these are used, care must be taken to update them reliably, [[!message-id
    "1123688017.3905.22.camel@buko.sinrega.org"]].  This could be checked by a
    static analysis tool.

# Dynamic

  * [[community/gsoc/project_ideas/Valgrind]]

  * glibc's `libmcheck`

      * Used by GDB, for example.

      * IRC, freenode, #glibc, 2011-09-28

            <vsrinivas> two things you can do -- there is an environment
              variable (DEBUG_MALLOC_ iirc?) that can be set to 2 to make
              ptmalloc (glibc's allocator) more forceful and verbose wrt error
              checking
            <vsrinivas> another is to grab a copy of Tor's source tree and copy
              out OpenBSD's allocator (its a clearly-identifyable file in the
              tree); LD_PRELOAD it or link it into your app, it is even more
              aggressive about detecting memory misuse.
            <vsrinivas> third, Red hat has a gdb python plugin that can
              instrument glibc's heap structure. its kinda handy, might help?
            <vsrinivas> MALLOC_CHECK_ was the envvar you want, sorry.

  * Mayhem, *an automatic bug finding system*

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-06-29:

        <teythoon> started reading the mayhem paper referenced here
          http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/06/msg00720.html
        <teythoon> that's nice work, they are doing symbolic execution of x86
          binary code, that's effectively model checking with some specialized
          formulas
        <teythoon> (too bad the mayhem code isn't available, damn those
          academic people keeping the good stuff to themselvs...)
        <teythoon> (and I really think that's bad practice, how should anyone
          reproduce their results? that's not how science works imho...)
