[[Etenil]] has been working in this area.


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-02-13

    <etenil> youpi: Would libdiskfs/diskfs.h be in the right place to make
      readahead functions?
    <youpi> etenil: no, it'd rather be at the memory management layer,
      i.e. mach, unfortunately
    <youpi> because that's where you see the page faults
    <etenil> youpi: Linux also provides a readahead() function for higher level
      applications. I'll probably have to add the same thing in a place that's
      higher level than mach
    <youpi> well, that should just be hooked to the same common implementation
    <etenil> the man page for readahead() also states that portable
      applications should avoid it, but it could be benefic to have it for
      portability
    <youpi> it's not in posix indeed


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-02-14

    <etenil> youpi: I've investigated prefetching (readahead) techniques. One
      called DiskSeen seems really efficient. I can't tell yet if it's patented
      etc. but I'll keep you informed
    <youpi> don't bother with complicated techniques, even the most simple ones
      will be plenty :)
    <etenil> it's not complicated really
    <youpi> the matter is more about how to plug it into mach
    <etenil> ok
    <youpi> then don't bother with potential pattents
    <antrik> etenil: please take a look at the work KAM did for last year's
      GSoC
    <youpi> just use a trivial technique :)
    <etenil> ok, i'll just go the easy way then

    <braunr> antrik: what was etenil referring to when talking about
      prefetching ?
    <braunr> oh, madvise() stuff
    <braunr> i could help him with that


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-02-15

    <etenil> oh, I'm looking into prefetching/readahead to improve I/O
      performance
    <braunr> etenil: ok
    <braunr> etenil: that's actually a VM improvement, like samuel told you
    <etenil> yes
    <braunr> a true I/O improvement would be I/O scheduling
    <braunr> and how to implement it in a hurdish way
    <braunr> (or if it makes sense to have it in the kernel)
    <etenil> that's what I've been wondering too lately
    <braunr> concerning the VM, you should look at madvise()
    <etenil> my understanding is that Mach considers devices without really
      knowing what they are
    <braunr> that's roughly the interface used both at the syscall() and the
      kernel levels in BSD, which made it in many other unix systems
    <etenil> whereas I/O optimisations are often hard disk drives specific
    <braunr> that's true for almost any kernel
    <braunr> the device knowledge is at the driver level
    <etenil> yes
    <braunr> (here, I separate kernels from their drivers ofc)
    <etenil> but Mach also contains some drivers, so I'm going through the code
      to find the apropriate place for these improvements
    <braunr> you shouldn't tough the drivers at all
    <braunr> touch
    <etenil> true, but I need to understand how it works before fiddling around
    <braunr> hm
    <braunr> not at all
    <braunr> the VM improvement is about pagein clustering
    <braunr> you don't need to know how pages are fetched
    <braunr> well, not at the device level
    <braunr> you need to know about the protocol between the kernel and
      external pagers
    <etenil> ok
    <braunr> you could also implement pageout clustering
    <etenil> if I understand you well, you say that what I'd need to do is a
      queuing system for the paging in the VM?
    <braunr> no
    <braunr> i'm saying that, when a page fault occurs, the kernel should
      (depending on what was configured through madvise()) transfer pages in
      multiple blocks rather than one at a time
    <braunr> communication with external pagers is already async, made through
      regular ports
    <braunr> which already implement message queuing
    <braunr> you would just need to make the mapped regions larger
    <braunr> and maybe change the interface so that this size is passed
    <etenil> mmh
    <braunr> (also don't forget that page clustering can include pages *before*
      the page which caused the fault, so you may have to pass the start of
      that region too)
    <etenil> I'm not sure I understand the page fault thing
    <etenil> is it like a segmentation error?
    <etenil> I can't find a clear definition in Mach's manual
    <braunr> ah
    <braunr> it's a fundamental operating system concept
    <braunr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_fault
    <etenil> ah ok
    <etenil> I understand now
    <etenil> so what's currently happening is that when a page fault occurs,
      Mach is transfering pages one at a time and wastes time 
    <braunr> sometimes, transferring just one page is what you want
    <braunr> it depends on the application, which is why there is madvise()
    <braunr> our rootfs, on the other hand, would benefit much from such an
      improvement
    <braunr> in UVM, this optimization is account for around 10% global
      performance improvement
    <braunr> accounted*
    <etenil> not bad
    <braunr> well, with an improved page cache, I'm sure I/O would matter less
      on systems with more RAM
    <braunr> (and another improvement would make mach support more RAM in the
      first place !)
    <braunr> an I/O scheduler outside the kernel would be a very good project
      IMO
    <braunr> in e.g. libstore/storeio
    <etenil> yes
    <braunr> but as i stated in my thesis, a resource scheduler should be as
      close to its resource as it can
    <braunr> and since mach can host several operating systems, I/O schedulers
      should reside near device drivers
    <braunr> and since current drivers are in the kernel, it makes sens to have
      it in the kernel too
    <braunr> so there must be some discussion about this
    <etenil> doesn't this mean that we'll have to get some optimizations in
      Mach and have the same outside of Mach for translators that access the
      hardware directly?
    <braunr> etenil: why ?
    <etenil> well as you said Mach contains some drivers, but in principle, it
      shouldn't, translators should do disk access etc, yes?
    <braunr> etenil: ok
    <braunr> etenil: so ?
    <etenil> well, let's say if one were to introduce SATA support in Hurd,
      nothing would stop him/her to do so with a translator rather than in Mach
    <braunr> you should avoid the term translator here
    <braunr> it's really hurd specific
    <braunr> let's just say a user space task would be responsible for that
      job, maybe multiple instances of it, yes
    <etenil> ok, so in this case, let's say we have some I/O optimization
      techniques like readahead and I/O scheduling within Mach, would these
      also apply to the user-space task, or would they need to be
      reimplemented?
    <braunr> if you have user space drivers, there is no point having I/O
      scheduling in the kernel
    <etenil> but we also have drivers within the kernel
    <braunr> what you call readahead, and I call pagein/out clustering, is
      really tied to the VM, so it must be in Mach in any case
    <braunr> well
    <braunr> you either have one or the other
    <braunr> currently we have them in the kernel
    <braunr> if we switch to DDE, we should have all of them outside
    <braunr> that's why such things must be discussed
    <etenil> ok so if I follow you, then future I/O device drivers will need to
      be implemented for Mach
    <braunr> currently, yes
    <braunr> but preferrably, someone should continue the work that has been
      done on DDe so that drivers are outside the kernel
    <etenil> so for the time being, I will try and improve I/O in Mach, and if
      drivers ever get out, then some of the I/O optimizations will need to be
      moved out of Mach
    <braunr> let me remind you one of the things i said
    <braunr> i said I/O scheduling should be close to their resource, because
      we can host several operating systems
    <braunr> now, the Hurd is the only system running on top of Mach
    <braunr> so we could just have I/O scheduling outside too
    <braunr> then you should consider neighbor hurds
    <braunr> which can use different partitions, but on the same device
    <braunr> currently, partitions are managed in the kernel, so file systems
      (and storeio) can't make good scheduling decisions if it remains that way
    <braunr> but that can change too
    <braunr> a single storeio representing a whole disk could be shared by
      several hurd instances, just as if it were a high level driver
    <braunr> then you could implement I/O scheduling in storeio, which would be
      an improvement for the current implementation, and reusable for future
      work
    <etenil> yes, that was my first instinct
    <braunr> and you would be mostly free of the kernel internals that make it
      a nightmare
    <etenil> but youpi said that it would be better to modify Mach instead
    <braunr> he mentioned the page clustering thing
    <braunr> not I/O scheduling
    <braunr> theseare really two different things
    <etenil> ok
    <braunr> you *can't* implement page clustering outside Mach because Mach
      implements virtual memory
    <braunr> both policies and mechanisms
    <etenil> well, I'd rather think of one thing at a time if that's alright
    <etenil> so what I'm busy with right now is setting up clustered page-in
    <etenil> which need to be done within Mach
    <braunr> keep clustered page-outs in mind too
    <braunr> although there are more constraints on those
    <etenil> yes
    <etenil> I've looked up madvise(). There's a lot of documentation about it
      in Linux but I couldn't find references to it in Mach (nor Hurd), does it
      exist?
    <braunr> well, if it did, you wouldn't be caring about clustered page
      transfers, would you ?
    <braunr> be careful about linux specific stuff
    <etenil> I suppose not
    <braunr> you should implement at least posix options, and if there are
      more, consider the bsd variants
    <braunr> (the Mach VM is the ancestor of all modern BSD VMs)
    <etenil> madvise() seems to be posix
    <braunr> there are system specific extensions
    <braunr> be careful
    <braunr> CONFORMING TO POSIX.1b.   POSIX.1-2001 describes posix_madvise(3)
      with constants POSIX_MADV_NORMAL, etc., with a behav‐ ior close to that
      described here.  There is a similar posix_fadvise(2) for file access.
    <braunr> MADV_REMOVE, MADV_DONTFORK, MADV_DOFORK, MADV_HWPOISON,
      MADV_MERGEABLE, and MADV_UNMERGEABLE  are  Linux- specific.
    <etenil> I was about to post these
    <etenil> ok, so basically madvise() allows tasks etc. to specify a usage
      type for a chunk of memory, then I could apply the relevant I/O
      optimization based on this
    <braunr> that's it
    <etenil> cool, then I don't need to worry about knowing what the I/O is
      operating on, I just need to apply the optimizations as advised
    <etenil> that's convenient
    <etenil> ok I'll start working on this tonight
    <etenil> making a basic readahead shouldn't be too hard
    <braunr> readahead is a misleading name
    <etenil> is pagein better?
    <braunr> applies to too many things, doesn't include the case where
      previous elements could be prefetched
    <braunr> clustered page transfers is what i would use
    <braunr> page prefetching maybe
    <etenil> ok
    <braunr> you should stick to something that's already used in the
      literature since you're not inventing something new
    <etenil> yes I've read a paper about prefetching
    <etenil> ok
    <etenil> thanks for your help braunr
    <braunr> sure
    <braunr> you're welcome
    <antrik> braunr: madvise() is really the least important part of the
      picture...
    <antrik> very few applications actually use it. but pretty much all
      applications will profit from clustered paging
    <antrik> I would consider madvise() an optional goody, not an integral part
      of the implementation
    <antrik> etenil: you can find some stuff about KAM's work on
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/user/kam.html
    <antrik> not much specific though
    <etenil> thanks
    <antrik> I don't remember exactly, but I guess there is also some
      information on the mailing list. check the archives for last summer
    <antrik> look for Karim Allah Ahmed
    <etenil> antrik: I disagree, madvise gives me a good starting point, even
      if eventually the optimisations should run even without it
    <antrik> the code he wrote should be available from Google's summer of code
      page somewhere...
    <braunr> antrik: right, i was mentioning madvise() because the kernel (VM)
      interface is pretty similar to the syscall
    <braunr> but even a default policy would be nice
    <antrik> etenil: I fear that many bits were discussed only on IRC... so
      you'd better look through the IRC logs from last April onwards...
    <etenil> ok

    <etenil> at the beginning I thought I could put that into libstore
    <etenil> which would have been fine

    <antrik> BTW, I remembered now that KAM's GSoC application should have a
      pretty good description of the necessary changes... unfortunately, these
      are not publicly visible IIRC :-(


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-02-16

    <etenil> braunr: I've looked in the kernel to see where prefetching would
      fit best. We talked of the VM yesterday, but I'm not sure about it. It
      seems to me that the device part of the kernel makes more sense since
      it's logically what manages devices, am I wrong?
    <braunr> etenil: you are
    <braunr> etenil: well
    <braunr> etenil: drivers should already support clustered sector
      read/writes
    <etenil> ah
    <braunr> but yes, there must be support in the drivers too
    <braunr> what would really benefit the Hurd mostly concerns page faults, so
      the right place is the VM subsystem

[[clustered_page_faults]]

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-03-21

    <mcsim> I thought that readahead should have some heuristics, like
      accounting size of object and last access time, but i didn't find any in
      kam's patch. Are heuristics needed or it will be overhead for
      microkernel? 
    <youpi> size  of object and last access time are not necessarily useful to
      take into account
    <youpi> what would usually typically be kept is the amount of contiguous
      data that has been read lately
    <youpi> to know whether it's random or sequential, and how much is read
    <youpi> (the whole size of the object does not necessarily give any
      indication of how much of it will be read)
    <mcsim> if big object is accessed often, performance could be increased if
      frame that will be read ahead will be increased too.
    <youpi> yes, but the size of the object really does not matter
    <youpi> you can just observe how much data is read and realize that it's
      read a lot
    <youpi> all the more so with userland fs translators
    <youpi> it's not because you mount a CD image that you need to read it all
    <mcsim> youpi: indeed. this will be better. But on other hand there is
      principle about policy and mechanism. And kernel should implement
      mechanism, but heuristics seems to be policy. Or in this case moving
      readahead policy to user level would be overhead?
    <antrik> mcsim: paging policy is all in kernel anyways; so it makes perfect
      sense to put the readahead policy there as well
    <antrik> (of course it can be argued -- probably rightly -- that all of
      this should go into userspace instead...)
    <mcsim> antrik: probably defpager partly could do that. AFAIR, it is
      possible for defpager to return more memory than was asked.
    <mcsim> antrik: I want to outline what should be done during gsoc. First,
      kernel should support simple readahead for specified number of pages
      (regarding direction of access) + simple heuristic for changing frame
      size. Also default pager could make some analysis, for instance if it has
      many data located consequentially it could return more data then was
      asked. For other pagers I won't do anything. Is it suitable?
    <antrik> mcsim: I think we actually had the same discussion already with
      KAM ;-)
    <antrik> for clustered pageout, the kernel *has* to make the decision. I'm
      really not convinced it makes sense to leave the decision for clustered
      pagein to the individual pagers
    <antrik> especially as this will actually complicate matters because a) it
      will require work in *every* pager, and b) it will probably make handling
      of MADVISE & friends more complex
    <antrik> implementing readahead only for the default pager would actually
      be rather unrewarding. I'm pretty sure it's the one giving the *least*
      benefit
    <antrik> it's much, much more important for ext2
    <youpi> mcsim: maybe try to dig in the irc logs, we discussed about it with
      neal. the current natural place would be the kernel, because it's the
      piece that gets the traps and thus knows what happens with each
      projection, while the backend just provides the pages without knowing
      which projection wants it. Moving to userland would not only be overhead,
      but quite difficult
    <mcsim> antrik: OK, but I'm not sure that I could do it for ext2. 
    <mcsim> OK, I'll dig.


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-04-01

    <mcsim> as part of implementing of readahead project I have to add
      interface for setting appropriate behaviour for memory range.  This
      interface than should be compatible with madvise call, that has a lot of
      possible advises, but most part of them are specific for Linux (according
      to man page). Should mach also support these Linux-specific values?
    <mcsim> p.s. these Linux-specific values shouldn't affect readahead
      algorithm.
    <youpi> the interface shouldn't prevent from adding them some day
    <youpi> so that we don't have to add them yet
    <mcsim> ok. And what behaviour with value MADV_NORMAL should be look like?
      Seems that it should be synonym to MADV_SEQUENTIAL, isn't it?
    <youpi> no, it just means "no idea what it is"
    <youpi> in the linux implementation, that means some given readahead value
    <youpi> while SEQUENTIAL means twice as much
    <youpi> and RANDOM means zero
    <mcsim> youpi: thank you.
    <mcsim> youpi: Than, it seems to be better that kernel interface for
      setting behaviour will accept readahead value, without hiding it behind
      such constants, like VM_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT (like it was in kam's
      patch). And than implementation of madvise will call vm_behaviour_set
      with appropriate frame size. Is that right?
    <youpi> question of taste, better ask on the list
    <mcsim> ok


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-06-09

    <mcsim> hello. What fictitious pages in gnumach are needed for?
    <mcsim> I mean why real page couldn't be grabbed straight, but in sometimes
      fictitious page is grabbed first and than converted to real?
    <braunr> mcsim: iirc, fictitious pages are needed by device pagers which
      must comply with the vm pager interface
    <braunr> mcsim: specifically, they must return a vm_page structure, but
      this vm_page describes device memory
    <braunr> mcsim: and then, it must not be treated like normal vm_page, which
      can be added to page queues (e.g. page cache)


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-06-22

    <mcsim> braunr: Ah. Patch for large storages introduced new callback
      pager_notify_evict. User had to define this callback on his own as
      pager_dropweak, for instance. But neal's patch change this. Now all
      callbacks could have any name, but user defines structure with pager ops
      and supplies it in pager_create.
    <mcsim> So, I just changed notify_evict to confirm it to new style.
    <mcsim> braunr: I want to changed interface of mo_change_attributes and
      test my changes with real partitions. For both these I have to update
      ext2fs translator, but both partitions I have are bigger than 2Gb, that's
      why I need apply this patch.z
    <mcsim> But what to do with mo_change_attributes? I need somehow inform
      kernel about page fault policy.
    <mcsim> When I change mo_ interface in kernel I have to update all programs
      that use this interface and ext2fs is one of them.

    <mcsim> braunr: Who do you think better to inform kernel about fault
      policy? At the moment I've added fault_strategy parameter that accepts
      following strategies: randow, sequential with single page cluster,
      sequential with double page cluster and sequential with quad page
      cluster. OSF/mach has completely another interface of
      mo_change_attributes. In OSF/mach mo_change_attributes accepts structure
      of parameter. This structure could have different formats depending o
    <mcsim> This rpc could be useful because it is not very handy to update
      mo_change_attributes for kernel, for hurd libs and for glibc. Instead of
      this kernel will accept just one more structure format.
    <braunr> well, like i wrote on the mailing list several weeks ago, i don't
      think the policy selection is of concern currently
    <braunr> you should focus on the implementation of page clustering and
      readahead
    <braunr> concerning the interface, i don't think it's very important
    <braunr> also, i really don't like the fact that the policy is per object
    <braunr> it should be per map entry
    <braunr> i think it mentioned that in my mail too
    <braunr> i really think you're wasting time on this
    <braunr> http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00064.html
    <braunr> http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-04/msg00029.html
    <braunr> mcsim: any reason you completely ignored those ?
    <mcsim> braunr: Ok. I'll do clustering for map entries.
    <braunr> no it's not about that either :/
    <braunr> clustering is grouping several pages in the same transfer between
      kernel and pager
    <braunr> the *policy* is held in map entries
    <antrik> mcsim: I'm not sure I properly understand your question about the
      policy interface... but if I do, it's IMHO usually better to expose
      individual parameters as RPC arguments explicitly, rather than hiding
      them in an opaque structure...
    <antrik> (there was quite some discussion about that with libburn guy)
    <mcsim> antrik: Following will be ok? kern_return_t vm_advice(map, address,
      length, advice, cluster_size)
    <mcsim> Where advice will be either random or sequential
    <antrik> looks fine to me... but then, I'm not an expert on this stuff :-)
    <antrik> perhaps "policy" would be clearer than "advice"?
    <mcsim> madvise has following prototype: int madvise(void *addr, size_t
      len, int advice);
    <mcsim> hmm... looks like I made a typo. Or advi_c_e is ok too?
    <antrik> advise is a verb; advice a noun... there is a reason why both
      forms show up in the madvise prototype :-)
    <mcsim> so final variant should be kern_return_t vm_advise(map, address,
      length, policy, cluster_size)?
    <antrik> mcsim: nah, you are probably right that its better to keep
      consistency with madvise, even if the name of the "advice" parameter
      there might not be ideal...
    <antrik> BTW, where does cluster_size come from? from the filesystem?
    <antrik> I see merits both to naming the parameter "policy" (clearer) or
      "advice" (more consistent) -- you decide :-)
    <mcsim> antrik: also there is variant strategy, like with inheritance :)
      I'll choose advice for now.
    <mcsim> What do you mean under "where does cluster_size come from"?
    <antrik> well, madvise doesn't have this parameter; so the value must come
      from a different source?
    <mcsim> in madvise implementation it could fixed value or somehow
      calculated basing on size of memory range. In OSF/mach cluster size is
      supplied too (via mo_change_attributes).
    <antrik> ah, so you don't really know either :-)
    <antrik> well, my guess is that it is derived from the cluster size used by
      the filesystem in question
    <antrik> so for us it would always be 4k for now
    <antrik> (and thus you can probably leave it out alltogether...)
    <antrik> well, fatfs can use larger clusters
    <antrik> I would say, implement it only if it's very easy to do... if it's
      extra effort, it's probably not worth it
    <mcsim> There is sense to make cluster size bigger for ext2 too, since most
      likely consecutive clusters will be within same group.
    <mcsim> But anyway I'll handle this later.
    <antrik> well, I don't know what cluster_size does exactly; but by the
      sound of it, I'd guess it makes an assumption that it's *always* better
      to read in this cluster size, even for random access -- which would be
      simply wrong for 4k filesystem clusters...
    <antrik> BTW, I agree with braunr that madvice() is optional -- it is way
      way more important to get readahead working as a default policy first


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-01

    <mcsim> youpi: Do you think you could review my code?
    <youpi> sure, just post it to the list
    <youpi> make sure to break it down into logical pieces
    <mcsim> youpi: I pushed it my branch at gnumach repository
    <mcsim> youpi: or it is still better to post changes to list?
    <youpi> posting to the list would permit feedback from other people too
    <youpi> mcsim: posix distinguishes normal, sequential and random
    <youpi> we should probably too
    <youpi> the system call should probably be named "vm_advise", to be a verb
      like allocate etc.
    <mcsim> youpi: ok. A have a talk with antrik regarding naming, I'll change
      this later because compiling of glibc take a lot of time.
    <youpi> mcsim: I find it odd that vm_for_every_page allocates non-existing
      pages
    <youpi> there should probably be at least a flag to request it or not
    <mcsim> youpi: normal policy is synonym to default. And this could be
      treated as either random or sequential, isn't it?
    <braunr> mcsim: normally, no
    <youpi> yes, the normal policy would be the default
    <youpi> it doesn't mean random or sequential
    <youpi> it's just to be a compromise between both
    <youpi> random is meant to make no read-ahead, since that'd be spurious
      anyway
    <youpi> while by default we should make readahead
    <braunr> and sequential makes even more aggressive readahead, which usually
      implies a greater number of pages to fetch
    <braunr> that's all
    <youpi> yes
    <youpi> well, that part is handled by the cluster_size parameter actually
    <braunr> what about reading pages preceding the faulted paged ?
    <mcsim> Shouldn't sequential clean some pages (if they, for example, are
      not precious) that are placed before fault page?
    <braunr> ?
    <youpi> that could make sense, yes
    <braunr> you lost me
    <youpi> and something that you wouldn't to with the normal policy
    <youpi> braunr: clear what has been read previously
    <braunr> ?
    <youpi> since the access is supposed to be sequential
    <braunr> oh
    <youpi> the application will proabably not re-read what was already read
    <braunr> you mean to avoid caching it ?
    <youpi> yes
    <braunr> inactive memory is there for that
    <youpi> while with the normal policy you'd assume that the application
      might want to go back etc.
    <youpi> yes, but you can help it
    <braunr> yes
    <youpi> instead of making other pages compete with it
    <braunr> but then, it's for precious pages
    <youpi> I have to say I don't know what a precious page it
    <youpi> s
    <youpi> does it mean dirty pages?
    <braunr> no
    <braunr> precious means cached pages
    <braunr> "If precious is FALSE, the kernel treats the data as a temporary
      and may throw it away if it hasn't been changed. If the precious value is
      TRUE, the kernel treats its copy as a data repository and promises to
      return it to the manager; the manager may tell the kernel to throw it
      away instead by flushing and not cleaning the data"
    <braunr> hm no
    <braunr> precious means the kernel must keep it
    <mcsim> youpi: According to vm_for_every_page. What kind of flag do you
      suppose? If object is internal, I suppose not to cross the bound of
      object, setting in_end appropriately in vm_calculate_clusters.
    <mcsim> If object is external we don't know its actual size, so we should
      make mo request first. And for this we should create fictitious  pages.
    <braunr> mcsim: but how would you implement this "cleaning" with sequential
      ?
    <youpi> mcsim: ah, ok, I thought you were allocating memory, but it's just
      fictitious pages
    <youpi> comment "Allocate a new page" should be fixed :)
    <mcsim> braunr: I don't now how I will implement this specifically (haven't
      tried yet), but I don't think that this is impossible
    <youpi> braunr: anyway it's useful as an example where normal and
      sequential would be different
    <braunr> if it can be done simply
    <braunr> because i can see more trouble than gains in there :)
    <mcsim> braunr: ok :)
    <braunr> mcsim: hm also, why fictitious pages ?
    <braunr> fictitious pages should normally be used only when dealing with
      memory mapped physically which is not real physical memory, e.g. device
      memory
    <mcsim> but vm_fault could occur when object represent some device memory.
    <braunr> that's exactly why there are fictitious pages
    <mcsim> at the moment of allocating of fictitious page it is not know what
      backing store of object is.
    <braunr> really ?
    <braunr> damn, i've got used to UVM too much :/
    <mcsim> braunr: I said something wrong?
    <braunr> no no
    <braunr> it's just that sometimes, i'm confusing details about the various
      BSD implementations i've studied
    <braunr> out-of-gsoc-topic question: besides network drivers, do you think
      we'll have other drivers that will run in userspace and have to implement
      memory mapping ? like framebuffers ?
    <braunr> or will there be a translation layer such as storeio that will
      handle mapping ?
    <youpi> framebuffers typically will, yes
    <youpi> that'd be antrik's work on drm
    <braunr> hmm
    <braunr> ok
    <youpi> mcsim: so does the implementation work, and do you see performance
      improvement?
    <mcsim> youpi: I haven't tested it yet with large ext2 :/
    <mcsim> youpi: I'm going to finish now moving of ext2 to new interface,
      than other translators in hurd repository and than finish memory policies
      in gnumach. Is it ok?
    <youpi> which new interface?
    <mcsim> Written by neal. I wrote some temporary code to make ext2 work with
      it, but I'm going to change this now.
    <youpi> you mean the old unapplied patch?
    <mcsim> yes
    <youpi> did you have a look at Karim's work?
    <youpi> (I have to say I never found the time to check how it related with
      neal's patch)
    <mcsim> I found only his work in kernel. I didn't see his work in applying
      of neal's patch.
    <youpi> ok
    <youpi> how do they relate with each other?
    <youpi> (I have never actually looked at either of them :/)
    <mcsim> his work in kernel and neal's patch?
    <youpi> yes
    <mcsim> They do not correlate with each other.
    <youpi> ah, I must be misremembering what each of them do
    <mcsim> in kam's patch was changes to support sequential reading in reverse
      order (as in OSF/Mach), but posix does not support such behavior, so I
      didn't implement this either.
    <youpi> I can't find the pointer to neal's patch, do you have it off-hand?
    <mcsim> http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.os.hurd.bugs/351
    <youpi> thx
    <youpi> I think we are not talking about the same patch from Karim
    <youpi> I mean lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00023.html
    <mcsim> I mean this patch:
      http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2010-06/msg00024.html 
    <mcsim> Oh.
    <youpi> ok
    <mcsim> seems, this is just the same
    <youpi> yes
    <youpi> from a non-expert view, I would have thought these patches play
      hand in hand, do they really?
    <mcsim> this patch is completely for kernel and neal's one is completely
      for libpager.
    <youpi> i.e. neal's fixes libpager, and karim's fixes the kernel
    <mcsim> yes
    <youpi> ending up with fixing the whole path?
    <youpi> AIUI, karim's patch will be needed so that your increased readahead
      will end up with clustered page request?
    <mcsim> I will not use kam's patch
    <youpi> is it not needed to actually get pages in together?
    <youpi> how do you tell libpager to fetch pages together?
    <youpi> about the cluster size, I'd say it shouldn't be specified at
      vm_advise() level
    <youpi> in other OSes, it is usually automatically tuned
    <youpi> by ramping it up to a maximum readahead size (which, however, could
      be specified)
    <youpi> that's important for the normal policy, where there are typically
      successive periods of sequential reads, but you don't know in advance for
      how long
    <mcsim> braunr said that there are legal issues with his code, so I cannot
      use it.
    <braunr> did i ?
    <braunr> mcsim: can you give me a link to the code again please ?
    <youpi> see above :)
    <braunr> which one ?
    <youpi> both
    <youpi> they only differ by a typo
    <braunr> mcsim: i don't remember saying that, do you have any link ?
    <braunr> or log ?
    <mcsim> sorry, can you rephrase "ending up with fixing the whole path"?
    <mcsim> cluster_size in vm_advise also could be considered as advise 
    <braunr> no
    <braunr> it must be the third time we're talking about this
    <youpi> mcsim: I mean both parts would be needed to actually achieve
      clustered i/o
    <braunr> again, why make cluster_size a per object attribute ? :(
    <youpi> wouldn't some objects benefit from bigger cluster sizes, while
      others wouldn't?
    <youpi> but again, I believe it should rather be autotuned
    <youpi> (for each object)
    <braunr> if we merely want posix compatibility (and for a first attempt,
      it's quite enough), vm_advise is good, and the kernel selects the
      implementation (and thus the cluster sizes)
    <braunr> if we want finer grained control, perhaps a per pager cluster_size
      would be good, although its efficiency depends on several parameters
    <braunr> (e.g. where the page is in this cluster)
    <braunr> but a per object cluster size is a large waste of memory
      considering very few applications (if not none) would use the "feature"
      ..
    <braunr> (if any*)
    <youpi> there must be a misunderstanding
    <youpi> why would it be a waste of memory?
    <braunr> "per object"
    <youpi> so?
    <braunr> there can be many memory objects in the kernel
    <youpi> so?
    <braunr> so such an overhead must be useful to accept it
    <youpi> in my understanding, a cluster size per object is just a mere
      integer for each object
    <youpi> what overhead?
    <braunr> yes
    <youpi> don't we have just thousands of objects?
    <braunr> for now
    <braunr> remember we're trying to remove the page cache limit :)
    <youpi> that still won't be more than tens of thousands of objects
    <youpi> times an integer
    <youpi> that's completely neglectible
    <mcsim> braunr: Strange, Can't find in logs. Weird things are happening in
      my memory :/ Sorry.
    <braunr> mcsim: i'm almost sure i never said that :/
    <braunr> but i don't trust my memory too much either
    <braunr> youpi: depends
    <youpi> mcsim: I mean both parts would be needed to actually achieve
      clustered i/o
    <mcsim> braunr: I made I call vm_advise that applies policy to memory range
      (vm_map_entry to be specific)
    <braunr> mcsim: good
    <youpi> actually the cluster size should even be per memory range
    <mcsim> youpi: In this sense, yes
    <youpi> k
    <mcsim> sorry, Internet connection lags
    <braunr> when changing a structure used to create many objects, keep in
      mind one thing
    <braunr> if its size gets larger than a threshold (currently, powers of
      two), the cache used by the slab allocator will allocate twice the
      necessary amount
    <youpi> sure
    <braunr> this is the case with most object caching allocators, although
      some can have specific caches for common sizes such as 96k which aren't
      powers of two
    <braunr> anyway, an integer is negligible, but the final structure size
      must be checked
    <braunr> (for both 32 and 64 bits)
    <mcsim> braunr: ok.
    <mcsim> But I didn't understand what should be done with cluster size in
      vm_advise? Should I delete it?
    <braunr> to me, the cluster size is a pager property
    <youpi> to me, the cluster size is a map property
    <braunr> whereas vm_advise indicates what applications want
    <youpi> you could have several process accessing the same file in different
      ways
    <braunr> youpi: that's why there is a policy
    <youpi> isn't cluster_size part of the policy?
    <braunr> but if the pager abilities are limited, it won't change much
    <braunr> i'm not sure
    <youpi> cluster_size is the amount of readahead, isn't it?
    <braunr> no, it's the amount of data in a single transfer
    <mcsim> Yes, it is.
    <braunr> ok, i'll have to check your code
    <youpi> shouldn't transfers permit unbound amounts of data?
    <mcsim> braunr: than I misunderstand what readahead is
    <braunr> well then cluster size is per policy :)
    <braunr> e.g. random => 0, normal => 3, sequential => 15
    <braunr> why make it per map entry ?
    <youpi> because it depends on what the application doezs
    <braunr> let me check the code
    <youpi> if it's accessing randomly, no need for big transfers
    <youpi> just page transfers will be fine
    <youpi> if accessing sequentially, rather use whole MiB of transfers
    <youpi> and these behavior can be for the same file
    <braunr> mcsim: the call is vm_advi*s*e
    <braunr> mcsim: the call is vm_advi_s_e
    <braunr> not advice
    <youpi> yes, he agreed earlier
    <braunr> ok
    <mcsim> cluster_size is the amount of data that I try to read at one time.
    <mcsim> at singe mo_data_request
    <mcsim> *single
    <youpi> which, to me, will depend on the actual map
    <braunr> ok so it is the transfer size
    <youpi> and should be autotuned, especially for normal behavior
    <braunr> youpi: it makes no sense to have both the advice and the actual
      size per map entry
    <youpi> to get big readahead with all apps
    <youpi> braunr: the size is not only dependent on the advice, but also on
      the application behavior
    <braunr> youpi: how does this application tell this ?
    <youpi> even for sequential, you shouldn't necessarily use very big amounts
      of transfers
    <braunr> there is no need for the advice if there is a cluster size
    <youpi> there can be, in the case of sequential, as we said, to clear
      previous pages
    <youpi> but otherwise, indeed
    <youpi> but for me it's the converse
    <youpi> the cluster size should be tuned anyway
    <braunr> and i'm against giving the cluster size in the advise call, as we
      may want to prefetch previous data as well
    <youpi> I don't see how that collides
    <braunr> well, if you consider it's the transfer size, it doesn't
    <youpi> to me cluster size is just the size of a window
    <braunr> if you consider it's the amount of pages following a faulted page,
      it will
    <braunr> also, if your policy says e.g. "3 pages before, 10 after", and
      your cluster size is 2, what happens ?
    <braunr> i would find it much simpler to do what other VM variants do:
      compute the I/O sizes directly from the policy
    <youpi> don't they autotune, and use the policy as a maximum ?
    <braunr> depends on the implementations
    <youpi> ok, but yes I agree
    <youpi> although casting the size into stone in the policy looks bogus to
      me
    <braunr> but making cluster_size part of the kernel interface looks way too
      messy
    <braunr> it is
    <braunr> that's why i would have thought it as part of the pager properties
    <braunr> the pager is the true component besides the kernel that is
      actually involved in paging ...
    <youpi> well, for me the flexibility should still  be per application
    <youpi> by pager you mean the whole pager, not each file, right?
    <braunr> if a pager can page more because e.g. it's a file system with big
      block sizes, why not fetch more ?
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> it could be each file
    <braunr> but only if we have use for it
    <braunr> and i don't see that currently
    <youpi> well, posix currently doesn't provide a way to set it
    <youpi> so it would be useless atm
    <braunr> i was thinking about our hurd pagers
    <youpi> could we perhaps say that the policy maximum could be a fraction of
      available memory?
    <braunr> why would we want that ?
    <youpi> (total memory, I mean)
    <youpi> to make it not completely cast into stone
    <youpi> as have been in the past in gnumach
    <braunr> i fail to understand :/
    <youpi> there must be a misunderstanding then
    <youpi> (pun not intended)
    <braunr> why do you want to limit the policy maximum ?
    <youpi> how to decide it?
    <braunr> the pager sets it
    <youpi> actually I don't see how a pager could decide it
    <youpi> on what ground does it make the decision?
    <youpi> readahead should ideally be as much as 1MiB
    <braunr> 02:02 < braunr> if a pager can page more because e.g. it's a file
      system with big block sizes, why not fetch more ?
    <braunr> is the example i have in mind
    <braunr> otherwise some default values
    <youpi> that's way smaller than 1MiB, isn't it?
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> and 1 MiB seems a lot to me :)
    <youpi> for readahead, not really
    <braunr> maybe for sequential
    <youpi> that's what we care about!
    <braunr> ah, i thought we cared about normal
    <youpi> "as much as 1MiB", I said
    <youpi> I don't mean normal :)
    <braunr> right
    <braunr> but again, why limit ?
    <braunr> we could have 2 or more ?
    <youpi> at some point you don't get more efficiency
    <youpi> but eat more memory
    <braunr> having the pager set the amount allows us to easily adjust it over
      time
    <mcsim> braunr: Do you think that readahead should be implemented in
      libpager?
    <youpi> than needed
    <braunr> mcsim: no
    <braunr> mcsim: err
    <braunr> mcsim: can't answer
    <youpi> mcsim: do you read the log of what you have missed during
      disconnection?
    <braunr> i'm not sure about what libpager does actually
    <mcsim> yes
    <braunr> for me it's just mutualisation of code used by pagers
    <braunr> i don't know the details
    <braunr> youpi: yes
    <braunr> youpi: that's why we want these values not hardcoded in the kernel
    <braunr> youpi: so that they can be adjusted by our shiny user space OS
    <youpi> (btw apparently linux uses minimum 16k, maximum 128 or 256k)
    <braunr> that's more reasonable
    <youpi> that's just 4 times less :)
    <mcsim> braunr: You say that pager should decide how much data should be
      read ahead, but each pager can't implement it on it's own as there will
      be too much overhead. So the only way is to implement this in libpager.
    <braunr> mcsim: gni ?
    <braunr> why couldn't they ?
    <youpi> mcsim: he means the size, not the actual implementation
    <youpi> the maximum size, actually
    <braunr> actually, i would imagine it as the pager giving per policy
      parameters
    <youpi> right
    <braunr> like how many before and after
    <youpi> I agree, then
    <braunr> the kernel could limit, sure, to avoid letting pagers use
      completely insane values
    <youpi> (and that's just a max, the kernel autotunes below that)
    <braunr> why not
    <youpi> that kernel limit could be a fraction of memory, then?
    <braunr> it could, yes
    <braunr> i see what you mean now
    <youpi> mcsim: did you understand our discussion?
    <youpi> don't hesitate to ask for clarification
    <mcsim> I supposed cluster_size to be such parameter. And advice will help
      to interpret this parameter (whether data should be read after fault page
      or some data should be cleaned before)
    <youpi> mcsim: we however believe that it's rather the pager than the
      application that would tell that
    <youpi> at least for the default values
    <youpi> posix doesn't have a way to specify it, and I don't think it will
      in the future
    <braunr> and i don't think our own hurd-specific programs will need more
      than that
    <braunr> if they do, we can slightly change the interface to make it a per
      object property
    <braunr> i've checked the slab properties, and it seems we can safely add
      it per object
    <braunr> cf http://www.sceen.net/~rbraun/slabinfo.out
    <braunr> so it would still be set by the pager, but if depending on the
      object, the pager could set different values
    <braunr> youpi: do you think the pager should just provide one maximum size
      ? or per policy sizes ?
    <youpi> I'd say per policy size
    <youpi> so people can increase sequential size like crazy when they know
      their sequential applications need it, without disturbing the normal
      behavior
    <braunr> right
    <braunr> so the last decision is per pager or per object
    <braunr> mcsim: i'd say whatever makes your implementation simpler :)
    <mcsim> braunr: how kernel knows that object are created by specific pager?
    <braunr> that's the kind of things i'm referring to with "whatever makes
      your implementation simpler"
    <braunr> but usually, vm_objects have an ipc port and some properties
      relatedto their pagers
    <braunr> -usually
    <braunr> the problem i had in mind was the locking protocol but our spin
      locks are noops, so it will be difficult to detect deadlocks
    <mcsim> braunr: and for every policy there should be variable in vm_object
      structure with appropriate cluster_size?
    <braunr> if you want it per object, yes
    <braunr> although i really don't think we want it
    <youpi> better keep it per pager for now
    <braunr> let's imagine youpi finishes his 64-bits support, and i can
      successfully remove the page cache limit
    <braunr> we'd jump from 1.8 GiB at most to potentially dozens of GiB of RAM
    <braunr> and 1.8, mostly unused
    <braunr> to dozens almost completely used, almost all the times for the
      most interesting use cases
    <braunr> we may have lots and lots of objects to keep around
    <braunr> so if noone really uses the feature ... there is no point
    <youpi> but also lots and lots of memory to spend on it :)
    <youpi> a lot of objects are just one page, but a lof of them are not
    <braunr> sure
    <braunr> we wouldn't be doing that otherwise :)
    <braunr> i'm just saying there is no reason to add the overhead of several
      integers for each object if they're simply not used at all
    <braunr> hmm, 64-bits, better page cache, clustered paging I/O :>
    <braunr> (and readahead included in the last ofc)
    <braunr> good night !
    <mcsim> than, probably, make system-global max-cluster_size? This will save
      some memory. Also there is usually no sense in reading really huge chunks
      at once.
    <youpi> but that'd be tedious to set
    <youpi> there are only a few pagers, that's no wasted memory
    <youpi> the user being able to set it for his own pager is however a very
      nice feature, which can be very useful for databases, image processing,
      etc.
    <mcsim> In conclusion I have to implement following: 3 memory policies per
      object and per vm_map_entry. Max cluster size for every policy should be
      set per pager.
    <mcsim> So, there should be 2 system calls for setting memory policy and
      one for setting cluster sizes.
    <mcsim> Also amount of data to transfer should be tuned automatically by
      every page fault. 
    <mcsim> youpi: Correct me, please, if I'm wrong.
    <youpi> I believe that's what we ended up to decide, yes


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-02

    <braunr> is it safe to say that all memory objects implemented by external
      pagers have "file" semantics ?
    <braunr> i wonder if the current memory manager interface is suitable for
      device pagers
    <mcsim> braunr: What does "file" semantics mean?
    <braunr> mcsim: anonymous memory doesn't have the same semantics as a file
      for example
    <braunr> anonymous memory that is discontiguous in physical memory can be
      contiguous in swap
    <braunr> and its location can change with time
    <braunr> whereas with a memory object, the data exchanged with pagers is
      identified with its offset
    <braunr> in (probably) all other systems, this way of specifying data is
      common to all files, whatever the file system
    <braunr> linux uses the struct vm_file name, while in BSD/Solaris they are
      called vnodes (the link between a file system inode and virtual memory)
    <braunr> my question is : can we implement external device pagers with the
      current interface, or is this interface really meant for files ?
    <braunr> also
    <braunr> mcsim: something about what you said yesterday
    <braunr> 02:39 < mcsim> In conclusion I have to implement following: 3
      memory policies per object and per vm_map_entry. Max cluster size for
      every policy should be set per pager.
    <braunr> not per object
    <braunr> one policy per map entry
    <braunr> transfer parameters (pages before and after the faulted page) per
      policy, defined by pagers
    <braunr> 02:39 < mcsim> So, there should be 2 system calls for setting
      memory policy and one for setting cluster sizes.
    <braunr> adding one call for vm_advise is good because it mirrors the posix
      call
    <braunr> but for the parameters, i'd suggest changing an already existing
      call
    <braunr> not sure which one though
    <mcsim> braunr: do you know how mo_change_attributes implemented in
      OSF/Mach?
    <braunr> after a quick reading of the reference manual, i think i
      understand why they made it per object
    <braunr> mcsim: no
    <braunr> did they change the call to include those paging parameters ?
    <mcsim> it accept two parameters: flavor and pointer to structure with
      parameters.
    <mcsim> flavor determines semantics of structure with parameters.
    <mcsim>
      http://www.darwin-development.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/osfmk/src/mach_kernel/vm/memory_object.c?rev=1.1
    <mcsim> structure can have 3 different views and what exect view will be is
      determined by value of flavor
    <mcsim> So, I thought about implementing similar call that could be used
      for various purposes.
    <mcsim> like ioctl
    <braunr> "pointer to structure with parameters" <= which one ?
    <braunr> mcsim: don't model anything anywhere like ioctl please
    <mcsim> memory_object_info_t	attributes
    <braunr> ioctl is the very thing we want NOT to have on the hurd
    <braunr> ok attributes
    <braunr> and what are the possible values of flavour, and what kinds of
      attributes ?
    <mcsim> and then appears something like this on each case: behave =
      (old_memory_object_behave_info_t) attributes;
    <braunr> ok i see
    <mcsim> flavor could be  OLD_MEMORY_OBJECT_BEHAVIOR_INFO,
      MEMORY_OBJECT_BEHAVIOR_INFO, MEMORY_OBJECT_PERFORMANCE_INFO etc
    <braunr> i don't really see the point of flavour here, other than
      compatibility
    <braunr> having attributes is nice, but you should probably add it as a
      call parameter, not inside a structure
    <braunr> as a general rule, we don't like passing structures too much
      to/from the kernel, because handling them with mig isn't very clean
    <mcsim> ok
    <mcsim> What policy parameters should be defined by pager?
    <braunr> i'd say number of pages to page-in before and after the faulted
      page
    <mcsim> Only pages before and after the faulted page?
    <braunr> for me yes
    <braunr> youpi might have different things in mind
    <braunr> the page cleaning in sequential mode is something i wouldn't do
    <braunr> 1/ applications might want data read sequentially to remain in the
      cache, for other sequential accesses
    <braunr> 2/ applications that really don't want to cache anything should
      use O_DIRECT
    <braunr> 3/ it's complicated, and we're in july
    <braunr> i'd rather have a correct and stable result than too many unused
      features
    <mcsim> braunr: MADV_SEQUENTIAL Expect page references in sequential order.
      (Hence, pages in the given range can be aggressively read ahead, and may
      be freed soon after they are accessed.)
    <mcsim> this is from linux man
    <mcsim> braunr: Can I at least make keeping in mind that it could be
      implemented?
    <mcsim> I mean future rpc interface
    <mcsim> braunr: From behalf of kernel pager is just a port.
    <mcsim> That's why it is not clear for me how I can make in kernel
      per-pager policy
    <braunr> mcsim: you can't
    <braunr> 15:19 < braunr> after a quick reading of the reference manual, i
      think i understand why they made it per object
    <braunr>
      http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/posix_madvise.html
    <braunr> POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
    <braunr> Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
      range sequentially from lower addresses to higher addresses.
    <braunr> linux might free pages after their access, why not, but this is
      entirely up to the implementation
    <mcsim> I know, when but applications might want data read sequentially to
      remain in the cache, for other sequential accesses this kind of access
      could be treated rather normal or random
    <braunr> we can do differently
    <braunr> mcsim: no
    <braunr> sequential means the access will be sequential
    <braunr> so aggressive readahead (e.g. 0 pages before, many after), should
      be used
    <braunr> for better performance
    <braunr> from my pov, it has nothing to do with caching
    <braunr> i actually sometimes expect data to remain in cache
    <braunr> e.g. before playing a movie from sshfs, i sometimes prefetch it
      using dd
    <braunr> then i use mplayer
    <braunr> i'd be very disappointed if my data didn't remain in the cache :)
    <mcsim> At least these pages could be placed into inactive list to be first
      candidates for pageout.
    <braunr> that's what will happen by default
    <braunr> mcsim: if we need more properties for memory objects, we'll adjust
      the call later, when we actually implement them
    <mcsim> so, first call is vm_advise and second is changed
      mo_change_attributes?
    <braunr> yes
    <mcsim> there will appear 3 new parameters in mo_c_a: policy, pages before
      and pages after?
    <mcsim> braunr: With vm_advise I didn't understand one thing. This call is
      defined in defs file, so that should mean that vm_advise is ordinal rpc
      call. But on the same time it is defined as syscall in mach internals (in
      mach_trap_table).
    <braunr> mcsim: what ?
    <braunr> were is it "defined" ? (it doesn't exit in gnumach currently)
    <mcsim> Ok, let consider vm_map
    <mcsim> I define it both in mach_trap_table and in defs file.
    <mcsim> But why?
    <braunr> uh ?
    <braunr> let me see
    <mcsim> Why defining in defs file is not enough?
    <mcsim> and previous question: there will appear 3 new parameters in
      mo_c_a: policy, pages before and pages after?
    <braunr> mcsim: give me the exact file paths please
    <braunr> mcsim: we'll discuss the new parameters after
    <mcsim> kern/syscall_sw.c
    <braunr> right i see
    <mcsim> here mach_trap_table in defined
    <braunr> i think they're not used
    <braunr> they were probably introduced for performance
    <mcsim> and ./include/mach/mach.defs
    <braunr> don't bother adding vm_advise as a syscall
    <braunr> about the parameters, it's a bit more complicated
    <braunr> you should add 6 parameters
    <braunr> before and after, for the 3 policies
    <braunr> but
    <braunr> as seen in the posix page, there could be more policies ..
    <braunr> ok forget what i said, it's stupid
    <braunr> yes, the 3 parameters you had in mind are correct
    <braunr> don't forget a "don't change" value for the policy though, so the
      kernel ignores the before/after values if we don't want to change that
    <mcsim> ok
    <braunr> mcsim: another reason i asked about "file semantics" is the way we
      handle the cache
    <braunr> mcsim: file semantics imply data is cached, whereas anonymous and
      device memory usually isn't
    <braunr> (although having the cache at the vm layer instead of the pager
      layer allows nice things like the swap cache)
    <mcsim> But this shouldn't affect possibility of implementing of device
      pager.
    <braunr> yes it may
    <braunr> consider how a fault is actually handled by a device
    <braunr> mach must use weird fictitious pages for that
    <braunr> whereas it would be better to simply let the pager handle the
      fault as it sees fit
    <mcsim> setting may_cache to false should resolve the issue
    <braunr> for the caching problem, yes
    <braunr> which is why i still think it's better to handle the cache at the
      vm layer, unlike UVM which lets the vnode pager handle its own cache, and
      removes the vm cache completely
    <mcsim> The only issue with pager interface I see is implementing of
      scatter-gather DMA (as current interface does not support non-consecutive
      access)
    <braunr> right
    <braunr> but that's a performance issue
    <braunr> my problem with device pagers is correctness
    <braunr> currently, i think the kernel just asks pagers for "data"
    <braunr> whereas a device pager should really map its device memory where
      the fault happen
    <mcsim> braunr: You mean that every access to memory should cause page
      fault?
    <mcsim> I mean mapping of device memory
    <braunr> no
    <braunr> i mean a fault on device mapped memory should directly access a
      shared region
    <braunr> whereas file pagers only implement backing store
    <braunr> let me explain a bit more
    <braunr> here is what happens with file mapped memory
    <braunr> you map it, access it (some I/O is done to get the page content in
      physical memory), then later it's flushed back
    <braunr> whereas with device memory, there shouldn't be any I/O, the device
      memory should directly be mapped (well, some devices need the same
      caching behaviour, while others provide direct access)
    <braunr> one of the obvious consequences is that, when you map device
      memory (e.g. a framebuffer), you expect changes in your mapped memory to
      be effective right away
    <braunr> while with file mapped memory, you need to msync() it
    <braunr> (some framebuffers also need to be synced, which suggests greater
      control is needed for external pagers)
    <mcsim> Seems that I understand you. But how it is implemented in other
      OS'es? Do they set something in mmu?
    <braunr> mcsim: in netbsd, pagers have a fault operatin in addition to get
      and put
    <braunr> the device pager sets get and put to null and implements fault
      only
    <braunr> the fault callback then calls the d_mmap callback of the specific
      driver
    <braunr> which usually results in the mmu being programmed directly
    <braunr> (e.g. pmap_enter or similar)
    <braunr> in linux, i think raw device drivers, being implemented as
      character device files, must provide raw read/write/mmap/etc.. functions
    <braunr> so it looks pretty much similar
    <braunr> i'd say our current external pager interface is insufficient for
      device pagers
    <braunr> but antrik may know more since he worked on ggi
    <braunr> antrik: ^
    <mcsim> braunr: Seems he used io_map
    <braunr> mcsim: where ar eyou looking at ? the incubator ?
    <mcsim> his master's thesis
    <braunr> ah the thesis
    <braunr> but where ? :)
    <mcsim> I'll give you a link
    <mcsim> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/36519904/kgi_on_hurd.pdf
    <braunr> thanks
    <mcsim> see p 158
    <braunr> arg, more than 200 pages, and he says he's lazy :/
    <braunr> mcsim: btw, have a look at m_o_ready
    <mcsim> braunr: This is old form of mo_change attributes
    <mcsim> I'm not going to change it
    <braunr> mcsim: these are actually the default object parameters right ?
    <braunr> mcsim: if you don't change it, it means the kernel must set
      default values until the pager changes them, if it does
    <mcsim> yes.
    <antrik> mcsim: madvise() on Linux has a separate flag to indicate that
      pages won't be reused. thus I think it would *not* be a good idea to
      imply it in SEQUENTIAL
    <antrik> braunr: yes, my KMS code relies on mapping memory objects for the
      framebuffer
    <antrik> (it should be noted though that on "modern" hardware, mapping
      graphics memory directly usually gives very poor performance, and drivers
      tend to avoid it...)
    <antrik> mcsim: BTW, it was most likely me who warned about legal issues
      with KAM's work. AFAIK he never managed to get the copyright assignment
      done :-(
    <antrik> (that's not really mandatory for the gnumach work though... only
      for the Hurd userspace parts)
    <antrik> also I'd like to point out again that the cluster_size argument
      from OSF Mach was probably *not* meant for advice from application
      programs, but rather was supposed to reflect the cluster size of the
      filesystem in question. at least that sounds much more plausible to me...
    <antrik> braunr: I have no idea whay you mean by "device pager". device
      memory is mapped once when the VM mapping is established; there is no
      need for any fault handling...
    <antrik> mcsim: to be clear, I think the cluster_size parameter is mostly
      orthogonal to policy... and probably not very useful at all, as ext2
      almost always uses page-sized clusters. I'm strongly advise against
      bothering with it in the initial implementation
    <antrik> mcsim: to avoid confusion, better use a completely different name
      for the policy-decided readahead size
    <mcsim> antrik: ok
    <antrik> braunr: well, yes, the thesis report turned out HUGE; but the
      actual work I did on the KGI port is fairly tiny (not more than a few
      weeks of actual hacking... everything else was just brooding)
    <antrik> braunr: more importantly, it's pretty much the last (and only
      non-trivial) work I did on the Hurd :-(
    <antrik> (also, I don't think I used the word "lazy"... my problem is not
      laziness per se; but rather inability to motivate myself to do anything
      not providing near-instant gratification...)
    <braunr> antrik: right
    <braunr> antrik: i shouldn't consider myself lazy either
    <braunr> mcsim: i agree with antrik, as i told you weeks ago
    <braunr> about
    <braunr> 21:45 < antrik> mcsim: to be clear, I think the cluster_size
      parameter is mostly orthogonal to policy... and probably not very useful
      at all, as ext2 almost always uses page-sized clusters. I'm strongly
      advise against bothering with it
    <braunr>                 in the initial implementation
    <braunr> antrik: but how do you actually map device memory ?
    <braunr> also, strangely enough, here is the comment in dragonflys
      madvise(2)
    <braunr> 21:45 < antrik> mcsim: to be clear, I think the cluster_size
      parameter is mostly orthogonal to policy... and probably not very useful
      at all, as ext2 almost always uses page-sized clusters. I'm strongly
      advise against bothering with it
    <braunr>                 in the initial implementation
    <braunr> arg
    <braunr> MADV_SEQUENTIAL  Causes the VM system to depress the priority of
      pages immediately preceding a given page when it is faulted in.
    <antrik> braunr: interesting...
    <antrik> (about SEQUENTIAL on dragonfly)
    <antrik> as for mapping device memory, I just use to device_map() on the
      mem device to map the physical address space into a memory object, and
      then through vm_map into the driver (and sometimes application) address
      space
    <antrik> formally, there *is* a pager involved of course (implemented
      in-kernel by the mem device), but it doesn't really do anything
      interesting
    <antrik> thinking about it, there *might* actually be page faults involved
      when the address ranges are first accessed... but even then, the handling
      is really trivial and not terribly interesting
    <braunr> antrik: it does the most interesting part, create the physical
      mapping
    <braunr> and as trivial as it is, it requires a special interface
    <braunr> i'll read about device_map again
    <braunr> but yes, the fact that it's in-kernel is what solves the problem
      here
    <braunr> what i'm interested in is to do it outside the kernel :)
    <antrik> why would you want to do that?
    <antrik> there is no policy involved in doing an MMIO mapping
    <antrik> you ask for the pysical memory region you are interested in, and
      that's it
    <antrik> whether the kernel adds the page table entries immediately or on
      faults is really an implementation detail
    <antrik> braunr: ^
    <braunr> yes it's a detail
    <braunr> but do we currently have the interface to make such mappings from
      userspace ?
    <braunr> and i want to do that because i'd like as many drivers as possible
      outside the kernel of course
    <antrik> again, the userspace driver asks the kernel to establish the
      mapping (through device_map() and then vm_map() on the resulting memory
      object)
    <braunr> hm i'm missing something
    <braunr>
      http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/gnumach-doc/Device-Map.html#Device-Map
      <= this one ?
    <antrik> yes, this one
    <braunr> but this implies the device is implemented by the kernel
    <antrik> the mem device is, yes
    <antrik> but that's not a driver
    <braunr> ah
    <antrik> it's just the interface for doing MMIO
    <antrik> (well, any physical mapping... but MMIO is probably the only real
      use case for that)
    <braunr> ok
    <braunr> i was thinking about completely removing the device interface from
      the kernel actually
    <braunr> but it makes sense to have such devices there
    <antrik> well, in theory, specific kernel drivers can expose their own
      device_map() -- but IIRC the only one that does (besides mem of course)
      is maptime -- which is not a real driver either...
    <braunr> oh btw, i didn't know you had a blog :)
    <antrik> well, it would be possible to replace the device interface by
      specific interfaces for the generic pseudo devices... I'm not sure how
      useful that would be
    <braunr> there are lots of interesting stuff there
    <antrik> hehe... another failure ;-)
    <braunr> failure ?
    <antrik> well, when I realized that I'm speding a lot of time pondering
      things, and never can get myself to actually impelemnt any of them, I had
      the idea that if I write them down, there might at least be *some* good
      from it...
    <antrik> unfortunately it turned out that I need so much effort to write
      things down, that most of the time I can't get myself to do that either
      :-(
    <braunr> i see
    <braunr> well it's still nice to have it
    <antrik> (notice that the latest entry is two years old... and I haven't
      even started describing most of my central ideas :-( )
    <braunr> antrik: i tried to create a blog once, and found what i wrote so
      stupid i immediately removed it
    <antrik> hehe
    <antrik> actually some of my entries seem silly in retrospect as well...
    <antrik> but I guess that's just the way it is ;-)
    <braunr> :)
    <braunr> i'm almost sure other people would be interested in what i had to
      say
    <antrik> BTW, I'm actually not sure whether the Mach interfaces are
      sufficient to implement GEM/TTM... we would certainly need kernel support
      for GART (as for any other kind IOMMU in fact); but beyond that it's not
      clear to me
    <braunr> GEM ? TTM ? GART ?
    <antrik> GEM = Graphics Execution Manager. part of the "new" DRM interface,
      closely tied with KMS
    <antrik> TTM = Translation Table Manager. does part of the background work
      for most of the GEM drivers
    <braunr> "The Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) is a computer software
      system developed by Intel to do memory management for device drivers for
      graphics chipsets." hmm
    <antrik> (in fact it was originally meant to provide the actual interface;
      but the Inter folks decided that it's not useful for their UMA graphics)
    <antrik> GART = Graphics Aperture
    <antrik> kind of an IOMMU for graphics cards
    <antrik> allowing the graphics card to work with virtual mappings of main
      memory
    <antrik> (i.e. allowing safe DMA)
    <braunr> ok
    <braunr> all this graphics stuff looks so complex :/
    <antrik> it is
    <antrik> I have a whole big chapter on that in my thesis... and I'm not
      even sure I got everything right
    <braunr> what is nvidia using/doing (except for getting the finger) ?
    <antrik> flushing out all the details for KMS, GEM etc. took the developers
      like two years (even longer if counting the history of TTM)
    <antrik> Nvidia's proprietary stuff uses a completely own kernel interface,
      which is of course not exposed or docuemented in any way... but I guess
      it's actually similar in what it does)
    <braunr> ok
    <antrik> (you could ask the nouveau guys if you are truly
      interested... they are doing most of their reverse engineering at the
      kernel interface level)
    <braunr> it seems graphics have very special needs, and a lot of them
    <braunr> and the interfaces are changing often
    <braunr> so it's not that much interesting currently
    <braunr> it just means we'll probably have to change the mach interface too
    <braunr> like you said
    <braunr> so the answer to my question, which was something like "do mach
      external pagers only implement files ?", is likely yes
    <antrik> well, KMS/GEM had reached some stability; but now there are
      further changes ahead with the embedded folks coming in with all their
      dedicated hardware, calling for unified buffer management across the
      whole pipeline (from capture to output)
    <antrik> and yes: graphics hardware tends to be much more complex regarding
      the interface than any other hardware. that's because it's a combination
      of actual I/O (like most other devices) with a very powerful coprocessor
    <antrik> and the coprocessor part is pretty much unique amongst peripherial
      devices
    <antrik> (actually, the I/O part is also much more complex than most other
      hardware... but that alone would only require a more complex driver, not
      special interfaces)
    <antrik> embedded hardware makes it more interesting in that the I/O
      part(s) are separate from the coprocessor ones; and that there are often
      several separate specialised ones of each... the DRM/KMS stuff is not
      prepared to deal with this
    <antrik> v4l over time has evolved to cover such things; but it's not
      really the right place to implement graphics drivers... which is why
      there are not efforts to unify these frameworks. funny times...

    <braunr> mcsim: vm_for_every_page should be static
    <mcsim> braunr: ok
    <braunr> mcsim: see http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html
    <braunr> and it looks big enough that you shouldn't make it inline
    <braunr> let the compiler decide for you (which is possible only if the
      function is static)
    <braunr> (otherwise a global symbol needs to exist)
    <braunr> mcsim: i don't know where you copied that comment from, but you
      should review the description of the vm_advice call in mach.Defs
    <mcsim> braunr: I see
    <mcsim> braunr: It was vm_inherit :)
    <braunr> mcsim: why isn't NORMAL defined in vm_advise.h ?
    <braunr> mcsim: i figured actually ;)
    <mcsim> braunr: I was going to do it later when.
    <braunr> mcsim: for more info on inline, see
      http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle
    <braunr> arg that's an old one
    <mcsim> braunr: I know that I do not follow coding style
    <braunr> mcsim: this one is about linux :p
    <braunr> mcsim: http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle should
      have it
    <braunr> mcsim: "Chapter 15: The inline disease"
    <mcsim> I was going to fix it later during refactoring when I'll merge
      mplaneta/gsoc12/working to mplaneta/gsoc12/master
    <braunr> be sure not to forget :p
    <braunr> and the best not to forget is to do it asap
    <braunr> +way
    <mcsim> As to inline. I thought that even if I specify function as inline
      gcc makes final decision about it.
    <mcsim> There was a specifier that made function always inline, AFAIR.
    <braunr> gcc can force a function not to be inline, yes
    <braunr> but inline is still considered as a strong hint

    <mcsim1> braunr: hello. You've said that pager has to supply 2 values to
      kernel to give it an advice how execute page fault. These two values
      should be number of pages before and after the page where fault
      occurred. But for sequential policy number of pager before makes no
      sense. For random policy too. For normal policy it would be sane to make
      readahead symmetric. Probably it would be sane to make pager supply
      cluster_size (if it is necessary to supply any) that w
    <mcsim1> *that will be advice for kernel of least sane value? And maximal
      value will be f(free_memory, map_entry_size)?
    <antrik> mcsim1: I doubt symmetric readahead would be a good default
      policy... while it's hard to estimate an optimum over all typical use
      cases, I'm pretty sure most situtations will benefit almost exclusively
      from reading following pages, not preceeding ones
    <antrik> I'm not even sure it's useful to read preceding pages at all in
      the default policy -- the use cases are probably so rare that the penalty
      in all other use cases is not justified. I might be wrong on that
      though...
    <antrik> I wonder how other systems handle that
    <LarstiQ> antrik: if there is a mismatch between pages and the underlying
      store, like why changing small bits of data on an ssd is slow?
    <braunr> mcsim1: i don't see why not
    <braunr> antrik: netbsd reads a few pages before too
    <braunr> actually, what netbsd does vary on the version, some only mapped
      in resident pages, later versions started asynchronous transfers in the
      hope those pages would be there
    <antrik> LarstiQ: not sure what you are trying to say
    <braunr> in linux :
    <braunr> 321  *  MADV_NORMAL - the default behavior is to read clusters.
      This
    <braunr> 322  *              results in some read-ahead and read-behind.
    <braunr> not sure if it's actually what the implementation does
    <antrik> well, right -- it's probably always useful to read whole clusters
      at a time, especially if they are the same size as pages... that doesn't
      mean it always reads preceding pages; only if the read is in the middle
      of the cluster AIUI
    <LarstiQ> antrik: basically what braunr just pasted
    <antrik> and in most cases, we will want to read some *following* clusters
      as well, but probably not preceding ones
    * LarstiQ nods
    <braunr> antrik: the default policy is usually rather sequential
    <braunr> here are the numbers for netbsd
    <braunr>  166 static struct uvm_advice uvmadvice[] = {
    <braunr>  167         { MADV_NORMAL, 3, 4 },
    <braunr>  168         { MADV_RANDOM, 0, 0 },
    <braunr>  169         { MADV_SEQUENTIAL, 8, 7},
    <braunr>  170 };
    <braunr> struct uvm_advice {
    <braunr>          int advice;
    <braunr>          int nback;
    <braunr>          int nforw;
    <braunr> };
    <braunr> surprising isn't it ?
    <braunr> they may suggest sequential may be backwards too
    <braunr> makes sense
    <antrik> braunr: what are these numbers? pages?
    <braunr> yes
    <antrik> braunr: I suspect the idea behind SEQUENTIAL is that with typical
      sequential access patterns, you will start at one end of the file, and
      then go towards the other end -- so the extra clusters in the "wrong"
      direction do not actually come into play
    <antrik> only situation where some extra clusters are actually read is when
      you start in the middle of a file, and thus do not know yet in which
      direction the sequential read will go...
    <braunr> yes, there are similar comments in the linux code
    <braunr> mcsim1: so having before and after numbers seems both
      straightforward and in par with other implementations
    <antrik> I'm still surprised about the almost symmetrical policy for NORMAL
      though
    <antrik> BTW, is it common to use heuristics for automatically recognizing
      random and sequential patterns in the absence of explicit madise?
    <braunr> i don't know
    <braunr> netbsd doesn't use any, linux seems to have different behaviours
      for anonymous and file memory
    <antrik> when KAM was working on this stuff, someone suggested that...
    <braunr> there is a file_ra_state struct in linux, for per file read-ahead
      policy
    <braunr> now the structure is of course per file system, since they all use
      the same address
    <braunr> (which is why i wanted it to be per pager in the first place)
    <antrik> mcsim1: as I said before, it might be useful for the pager to
      supply cluster size, if it's different than page size. but right now I
      don't think this is something worth bothering with...
    <antrik> I seriously doubt it would be useful for the pager to supply any
      other kind of policy
    <antrik> braunr: I don't understand your remark about using the same
      address...
    <antrik> braunr: pre-mapping seems the obvious way to implement readahead
      policy
    <antrik> err... per-mapping
    <braunr> the ra_state (read ahead state) isn't the policy
    <braunr> the policy is per mapping, parts of the implementation of the
      policy is per file system
    <mcsim1> braunr: How do you look at following implementation of NORMAL
      policy: We have fault page that is current. Than we have maximal size of
      readahead block. First we find first absent pages before and after
      current. Than we try to fit block that will be readahead into this
      range. Here could be following situations: in range RBS/2 (RBS -- size of
      readahead block) there is no any page, so readahead will be symmetric; if
      current page is first absent page than all 
    <mcsim1> RBS block will consist of pages that are after current; on the
      contrary if current page is last absent than readahead will go backwards.
    <mcsim1> Additionally if current page is approximately in the middle of the
      range we can decrease RBS, supposing that access is random.
    <braunr> mcsim1: i think your gsoc project is about readahead, we're in
      july, and you need to get the job done
    <braunr> mcsim1: grab one policy that works, pages before and after are
      good enough
    <braunr> use sane default values, let the pagers decide if they want
      something else
    <braunr> and concentrate on the real work now
    <antrik> braunr: I still don't see why pagers should mess with that... only
      complicates matters IMHO
    <braunr> antrik: probably, since they almost all use the default
      implementation
    <braunr> mcsim1: just use sane values inside the kernel :p
    <braunr> this simplifies things by only adding the new vm_advise call and
      not change the existing external pager interface
