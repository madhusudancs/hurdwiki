This one may be considered as a testcase for [[I/O system
optimization|community/gsoc/project_ideas/disk_io_performance]].

It is taken from the [[binutils testsuite|binutils]],
`ld/ld-elf/sec64k.exp`, where this
test may occasionally [[trigger a timeout|binutils#64ksec]].  It is
extracted from cdf7c161ebd4a934c9e705d33f5247fd52975612 sources, 2010-10-24.

On the idle grubber, this one repeatedly takes a few minutes wall time to
complete successfully, contrary to a few seconds on a GNU/Linux system.

While processing the object files, there is heavy interaction with the relevant
[[hurd/translator/ext2fs]] process.  Running [[hurd/debugging/rpctrace]] on
the testee shows that (primarily) an ever-repeating series of `io_seek` and
`io_read` is being processed.  Running the testee on GNU/Linux with strace
shows the equivalent thing (`_llseek`, `read`) -- but Linux' I/O system isn't
as slow as the Hurd's.

As Samuel figured out later, this slowness may in fact be due to a Xen-specific
issue, see [[Xen_lseek]].  After the latter has been addressed, we can
re-evaluate this issue here.
