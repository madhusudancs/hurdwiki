All the following is based only on a first, and quick glance only.

We may want to have a look at Virtual Square / View-OS, and evaluate in which
ways this is related / implemented / implementable / usable / useful in a Hurd
environment, and even ;-) strive to collaborate with them.

[[I|tschwinge]] found this project very much by chance: on LinkedIn, they
posted a proposal for [DevRoom on Virtualization
Technologies](http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&gid=27213&type=member&item=31720076)
for [[community/meetings/FOSDEM_2011]].  LinkedIn sends out such posts in very
opaque emails from time to time (probably they'd look less opaque with a HTML
mail user agent), and I even bothered to have a look at it, and follow the link
to the web page, and not delete it straightway.

So, I had a quick look at the project:

This seems to be an amalgamation / combination of various virtualization
mechanisms / projects / ideas.  Virtualization is here meant in a broad sense,
including file system namespaces: our `chroot` / `settrans --chroot`;
networking configurations: our pfinet override stuff; system configuration:
subhurds?; current time, devices: likewise?; executable interpreter: our exec
server override stuff; "stat" virtualization: fakeroot; etc.  -- They seem to
do a lot of stuff that we also try to do / could do / can do.

In fact, this looks a bit like they're trying to bring some more of the Hurd's
[[hurd/concepts]] over to Unix / Linux, more than only the *usual VFS stuff*
(translators / FUSE).
