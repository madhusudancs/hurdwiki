    <teythoon> is there a libnetfs based translator that supports passive
      translators?
    <youpi> I don't see any at the top of my head, only with active ones such
      as hostmux
    <teythoon> I suspected as much since as far as I can tell libnetfs lacks
      some bits to make that even work
    <braunr> teythoon: the problem with passive translators is persistence
    <braunr> well, it's easy to store volatile passive translators in a
      libnetfs server
    <braunr> but usually, there is no backing store for them
    <braunr> ext2fs is the only one actually providing space to store their
      command line
    <teythoon> sure, but at least file_get_translator needs to work so that
      procfs can serve a mounts node
    <braunr> silly idea but
    <braunr> don't you want to directly add it to the procfs translator ?
    <teythoon> no, I think it's useful on its own
    <braunr> ok
    <braunr> then you may need to add the required support
    <teythoon> it even doubles as normal command line tool
    <teythoon> yes, I almost got it... or so I hope ;)
    <braunr> ok
    <teythoon> also, netfs_get_translator exists, so not supporting that feels
      like a bug to me
    <teythoon> could also be useful for a potential devfs translator
    <braunr> yes

    <teythoon> uh, the code duplication in lib*fs is really bad :/
    <teythoon> the code is mostly similar, though they have diverged and many
      little things are different so diffing them is very noisy
    <teythoon> stuff like file names or identifiers
    <teythoon> and I cannot figure out why my shiny passive translators are not
      started :/
    <teythoon> % showtrans tmp/mounts
    <teythoon> /hurd/mtab.fixed /
    <teythoon> % wc --bytes tmp/mounts
    <teythoon> 0 tmp/mounts
    <teythoon> and no mtab translator around either
