Seen in context of [[libpthread]], but probably not directly related to it.

    <gnu_srs> Do you also experience a frozen hurd console?
    <braunr> yes
    <braunr> i didn't check but i'm almost certain it's a bug in my branch
    <braunr> the replacement of condition_implies was a bit hasty in some
      places
    <braunr> this is why i want to rework it separately


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-09-03

    <gnu_srs> braunr: Did you find the cause of the Hurd console freeze for
      your libpthread branch?
    <braunr> gnu_srs: like i said, a bug
    <braunr> probably in the replacement of condition_implies
    <braunr> i rewrote that part in libpipe and it no works
    <braunr> now*

    <braunr> gnu_srs: the packages have been updated
    <braunr> and these apparently fix the hurd console issue correctly

## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-09-04

    <braunr> gnu_srs: this hurd console problem isn't fixed
    <braunr> it seems to be due to a race condition that only affects the first
      console
    <braunr> and by reading the code i can't see how it can even work oO
    <gnu_srs> braunr: just rebooted, tty1 is still locked, tty2-6 works. And
      the floppy error stays (maybe a kvm bug??) 
    <braunr> the floppy error is probably a kvm bug as we discussed
    <braunr> the tty1 locked isn't
    <braunr> i have it too
    <braunr> it seems to be a bug in the hurd console server
    <braunr> which is started by tty1, but for some reason, doesn't return a
      valid answer at init time
    <braunr> if you kill the term handling tty1, you'll see your first tty
      starts working
    <braunr> for now i'll try a hack that starts the hurd console server before
      the clients
    <braunr> doesn't work eh
    <braunr> tty1 is the only one started before runttys
    <braunr> indeed, fixing /etc/hurd/runsystem.gnu so that it doesn't touch
      tty1 fixes the problem
    <gnu_srs> do you have an explanation?
    <braunr> not really no
    <braunr> but it will do for now
    <pinotree> samuel added that with the comment above, apparently to
      workaround some other issue of the hurd console
    <braunr> i'm pretty sure the bug is already visible with cthreads
    <braunr> the first console always seems weird compared to the others
    <braunr> with a login: at the bottom of the screen
    <braunr> didn't you notice ?
    <pinotree> sometimes, but not often
    <braunr> typical of a race
    <pinotree> (at least for me)
    <braunr> pthreads being slightly slower exposes it
    <gnu_srs> confirmed, it works by commenting out touch /dev/tty1
    <gnu_srs> yes, the login is at the bottom of the screen, sometimes one in
      the upper part too:-/
    <braunr> so we have a new open issue
    <braunr> hm
    <braunr> exiting the first tty doesn't work
    <braunr> which makes me think of the issue we have with screen
    <gnu_srs> confirmed!
    <braunr> also, i don't understand why we have getty on tty1, but nothing on
      the other terminals
    <braunr> something is really wrong with terminals on hurd *sigh*
    <braunr> ah, the problem looks like it happens when getty attempts to
      handle a terminal !
    <braunr> gnu_srs: anyway, i don't think it should be blocking for the
      conversion to pthreads
    <braunr> but it would be better if someone could assign himself that bug
    <braunr> :)


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-09-05

    <antrik> braunr: the login at the bottom of the screen if from the Mach
      console I believe
    <braunr> antrik: well maybe, but it shouldn't be there anyway
    <antrik> braunr: why not?
    <antrik> it's confusing, but perfectly correct as far as I can tell
    <braunr> antrik: two login: on the same screen ?
    <braunr> antrik: it's even more confusing when comparing with other ttys
    <antrik> I mean it's correct from a techincal point of view... I'm not
      saying it's helpful for the user ;-)
    <braunr> i'm not even sure it's correct
    <braunr> i've double checked the pthreads patch and didn't see anything
      wrong there
    <antrik> perhaps the startup of the Hurd console could be delayed a bit to
      make sure it happens after the Mach console login is done printing
      stuff...
    <braunr> why are our gettys stubs ?
    <antrik> I never understood the point of a getty TBH...
    <braunr> well you need to communicate to something behind your terminal,
      don't you ?
    <braunr> with*
    <antrik> why not just launch the login program or login shell right away?
    <braunr> what if you want something else than a login program ?
    <antrik> like what?
    <antrik> and how would a getty help with that?
    <braunr> an ascii-art version of star wars
    <braunr> it would be configured to start something else
    <antrik> and why does that need a getty? why not just start something else
      directly?
    <braunr> well getty is about the serial line parameters actually
    <antrik> yeah, I had a vague understanding that it has something to do with
      serial lines (or real TTY lines)... but we hardly need that on local
      cosoles :-)
    <antrik> consoles
    <braunr> right
    <braunr> but then why even bother with something like runttys
    <antrik> well, something has to start the terminal servers?...
    <antrik> I might be confused though
    <braunr> what i don't understand is
    <braunr> why is there no getty at startup, whereas they are spawned when
      logging off ?
    <antrik> they are? that's fascinating indeed ;-)
    <braunr> does it behave like this on your old version ?
    <antrik> I don't remember ever having seen a "getty" process on my Hurd
      systems...
    <braunr> can you log on e.g. tty2 and then log out, and see ?
    <antrik> OTOH, I'm hardly ever using consoles...
    <antrik> hm... I think that should be possible remotely using the console
      client with ncurses driver? never tried that...
    <braunr> ncurses driver ?
    <braunr> hum i don't know, never tried either
    <braunr> and it may add other bugs :p
    <braunr> better wait to be close to the machine
    <antrik> hehe
    <antrik> well, it's a good excuse for trying the ncurses driver ;-)
    <antrik> hrm
    <antrik> alien:~# console -d ncursesw
    <antrik> console: loading driver `ncursesw' failed: Gratuitous error
    <antrik> I guess nobody tested that stuff in years
