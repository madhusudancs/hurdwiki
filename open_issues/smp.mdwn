    <braunr> i expect smp to be our next gsoc project


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-01-02

    <braunr> i'd like to mentor someone for adding smp to gnumach


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-03-14

    <braunr> but i'm afraid we'll have to fight obscur smp-safety issues
    <braunr> for one, drivers are much probably not smp safe and would require
      a big kernel lock
    <braunr> userspace (such as signal delivery in libc) might be affected too
    <braunr> smp isn't that easy

This task actually looks too big for a GSoC project.


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-09-30

    <braunr> also, while the problem with hurd is about I/O, it's actually a
      lot more about caching, and even with more data cached in, the true
      problem is contention, in which case having several processors would
      actually slow things down even more
