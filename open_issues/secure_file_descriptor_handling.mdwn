`O_CLOEXEC`, `dup3` et al.; see
<http://udrepper.livejournal.com/20407.html>.  [[tschwinge]] once worked
on this, posted patches to [[mailing_lists/libc-alpha]].  This works needs to
be resumed
and finished.

Add tests from Linux kernel commit messages for `t/dup3` et al.

Validate completeness according to <https://wiki.freebsd.org/AtomicCloseOnExec>
or a similar list.

In <http://lwn.net/Articles/417421/> an interesting point is made: *you [may]
want some [[unix/file_descriptor]] to still be open if 'exec' fails, but you
don't want it to be open after the exec succeeds*.  [[I|tschwinge]]'m not sure
whether our current `O_CLOEXEC` implementation adheres to that.
