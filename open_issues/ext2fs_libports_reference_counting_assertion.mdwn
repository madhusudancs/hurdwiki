    libports/port-ref.c:31: ports_port_ref: Assertion `pi->refcnt || pi->weakrefcnt' failed

This is seen every now and then.


# [[gnumach_page_cache_policy]]

With that patch in place, the assertion failure is seen more often.

    <youpi> braunr: I'm getting ext2fs.static:
      /usr/src/hurd-debian/./libports/port-ref.c:31: ports_port_ref: Assertion
      `pi->refcnt || pi->weakrefcnt' failed.
    <youpi> oddly enough, that happens on one of the buildds only
    <braunr> :/
    <braunr> i fear the patch can wake many of these issues


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-07-15

    <youpi> braunr: same assertion failed on a second buildd
    <braunr> can you paste it again please ?
    <youpi> ext2fs.static: /usr/src/hurd-debian/./libports/port-ref.c:31:
      ports_port_ref: Assertion `pi->refcnt || pi->weakrefcnt' failed.
    <braunr> or better, answer the ml thread for future reference
    <braunr> thanks
    <youpi> braunr: I can't keep your patch on the buildds, it makes them too
      unreliable
    <braunr> youpi: ok
    <braunr> i never got this error though, that's weird
    <braunr> youpi: was the failure during the same build ?
    <youpi> no, it was during package installation, and not the same
    <youpi> braunr: note that I've already seen such errors, it's not new, but
      it was way rarer
    <youpi> like every month only
    <braunr> ah ok
    <braunr> yes it's less surprising then
    <braunr> a tricky reference counting / locking mistake somewhere in the
      hurd :) ...
    <braunr> ah ! just got it !
    <bddebian> braunr: Got the error or found the problem? :)
    <braunr> the former unfortunately :/

    <braunr> hm, i think those ext2fs port refs errors may also be due to stack
      overflows
    <pinotree> --verbose
    <braunr> hm ?
    <braunr> http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2012-07/msg00051.html
    <pinotree> i mean, why do you think they could be due to that?
    <braunr> the error is that both strong and weak refs in a port are 0 when
      adding a reference
    <braunr> weak refs are almost never used so let's forget about them
    <braunr> when a ref count drops to 0, the port is automatically deallocated
    <braunr> so what other than memory corruption setting this counter to 0
      could possibly do that ? :)
    <pinotree> one could also guess an unbalanced ref/unref logic, somehow
    <braunr> what do you mean ?
    <pinotree> that for a bug, an early return, etc a port gets unref'ed often
      than it is ref'ed
    <braunr> highly unlikely, as they're protected by a lock
    <braunr> pinotree: ah you mean, the object gets deallocated early because
      of an deref overflow ?
    <braunr> pinotree: could be, yes
    <braunr> pinotree: i wonder if it could happen because of the periodic sync
      duplicating the node table without holding references
    <braunr> rah, libports uses a big lock in many places :(
    <pinotree> braunr: yes, i meant that
    <braunr> we could try using libduma some day
    <braunr> i wonder if it could work out of the box
    <pinotree> but that wouldn't help to find out whether a port gets deref'ed
      too often, for instance
    <pinotree> although it could be adapted to do so, i guess
    <braunr> reproducing + a call trace or core would be best, but i'm not even
      sure we can get that easily lol

    <braunr> mhmm, i may have an explanation for the weird assertions we
      sometimes see in ext2fs
    <braunr> glibc uses alloca to reserve memory for one reply port per thread
      in abort_all_rpcs
    <braunr> if this erases the thread-specific area, we can expect all kinds
      of wreckage
    <braunr> i'm not sure how to fix this though


# IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2014-01-29
