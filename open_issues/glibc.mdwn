    Might simply be a missing patch(es) from master.

  * `--disable-multi-arch`

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-11-22

        <pinotree> tschwinge: is your glibc build w/ or w/o multiarch?
        <tschwinge> pinotree: See open_issues/glibc: --disable-multi-arch
        <pinotree> ah, because you do cross-compilation?
        <tschwinge> No, that's natively.
        <tschwinge> There is also a not of what happened in cross-gnu when I
          enabled multi-arch.
        <tschwinge> No idea whether that's still relevant, though.
        <pinotree> EPARSE
        <tschwinge> s%not%note
        <tschwinge> Better?
        <pinotree> yes :)
        <tschwinge> As for native builds: I guess I just didn't (want to) play
          with it yet.
        <pinotree> it is enabled in debian since quite some time, maybe other
          i386/i686 patches (done for linux) help us too
        <tschwinge> I though we first needed some CPU identification
          infrastructe before it can really work?
        <tschwinge> I thought [...].
        <pinotree> as in use the i686 variant as runtime automatically? i guess
          so
        <tschwinge> I thought I had some notes about that, but can't currently
          find them.
        <tschwinge> Ah, I probably have been thinking about open_issues/ifunc
          and open_issues/libc_variant_selection.

  * --build=X

    `long double` test: due to `cross_compiling = maybe` wants to execute a
    file, which fails.  Thus `--build=X` has to be set.

  * Verify 77c84aeb81808c3109665949448dba59965c391e against
    `~/shared/glibc/make_TAGS.patch`.

  * `HP_SMALL_TIMING_AVAIL` not defined anywhere.

  * Unify `CPUCLOCK_WHICH` stuff in `clock_*` files.

  * Not all tests are re-run in a `make -k tests; make tests-clean; make -k
    tests` cycle.  For example, after `make tests-clean`:

  * Missing interfaces, amongst many more.

    Many more are missing, some of which have been announced in `NEWS`, others
    typically haven't (like new flags to existing functions).  Typically,
    porters will notice missing functionaly.  But in case you're looking for
    something to work on, here's a list.

    `AT_EMPTY_PATH`, `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`, `CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM`,
    `CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM`, `O_PATH`,
    `PTRACE_*` (for example, cbff0d9689c4d68578b6a4f0a17807232506ea27),
    `RLIMIT_RTTIME`, `SEEK_DATA` (`unistd.h`), `SEEK_HOLE` (`unistd.h`)
    `clock_adjtime`, `fallocate`, `fallocate64`, `name_to_handle_at`,
    `open_by_handle_at`, `process_vm_readv`, `process_vm_writev`, `sendmmsg`,
    `setns`, `sync_file_range`

      * `chflags`

        IRC, OFTC, #debian-hurd, 2012-04-27:

            <Steap> Does anyone have any idea why int main(void) { return
              chflags(); } will compile with gcc but not with g++ ? It says
              that "chflags" was not declared in this scope.
            <Steap> I get the same error on FreeBSD, but including sys/stat.h
              makes it work
            <Steap> Can't find a solution on Hurd though :/
            <youpi> the Hurd doesn't have chflags
            <youpi> apparently linux neither
            <youpi> what does it do?
            <Steap> change flags :)
            <Steap> Are you sure the Hurd does not have chflags ? Because gcc
              does not complain
            <youpi> there is no chflags function in /usr/include
            <youpi> but what flags does it change?
            <Steap> According to the FreeBSD manpage, it can set flags such as
              UF_NODUMP, UF_IMMUTABLE etc.
            <youpi> Hum, there is actually a chflags() definition
            <youpi> but no declaration
            <youpi> so actually chflags is supported, but the declaration was
              forgotten
            <youpi> probably because since linux doens't have it, it has never
              been a problem up to now
            <youpi> so I'd say ignore the error for now, we'll add the
              declaration

      * `getcontext`/`setcontext`

        Needed for [[gccgo]].

        IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-04-19:

            <gnu_srs> How much work/knowledge is needed to implement
              getcontext/setcontext?
            <gnu_srs> Any already implemented alternatives available?
            <youpi> x86 registers knowledge, as well as unix signal masks
            <youpi> there's the linux implementation that can be taken as an
              exxample, but the signal part has to be rewritten
            <gnu_srs> Well, it's a pity they are not implemented. That's the
              remaining hurdle to get gccgo working :-( 
            <youpi> uh :/
            <gnu_srs> Everything builds, but the testsuite fails due to these
              missing functions.
            <gnu_srs> Regarding getcontext/setcontext they seem to be written
              in assembly for linux but the code is not very long. 
            <gnu_srs> How much effort would it be to write something similar
              for Hurd? Anybody fluent in asm?
            <gnu_srs> And registers and signals.
            <tschwinge> gnu_srs: Signals is the key thing -- everything else we
              can probably just copy.  I have never/not yet looked at it,
              though.
            <gnu_srs> For kfreebsd it is written in C: kern_context.c, 3/4 in
              one file: getcontext, setcontext,  swapcontext, not makecontext.
            <gnu_srs> Dunno how much assembly calls used though.
            <gnu_srs> Hi, any preferences about implementing get/setcontext in
              C or Asm?
            <tschwinge> gnu_srs: I think these will have to be implemented in
              assembly.  Based on the Linux x86 variants.

        IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-04-20:

            <tschwinge> youpi: Your understanding of that is better than mine
              -- the *context stuff can't be very useful at the moment, because
              when the user changes uc_stack.ss_sp (which the glibc tests are
              doing), we're losing access to the _hurd_threadvars.  Correct?
            <tschwinge> At least the getcontext test works, the other get a
              SIGILL.
            <tschwinge> others
            <tschwinge> _hurd_threadvars issue is just guessing.
            <youpi> tschwinge: yes, threadvars are on the stack
            <youpi> threadvars is not much code, it should just work, but care
              has to be taken on the libpthread/libthread side, which does some
              initialization
            <tschwinge> OK, that at least matches my understanding.

      * [[`mremap`|mremap]]

      * `syncfs`

        We should be easily able to implement that one.

      * `futimesat`, `readlinkat`, `renameat`

        If we have all of 'em (check Linux kernel), `#define __ASSUME_ATFCTS`.

      * `bits/stat.h [__USE_ATFILE]`: `UTIME_NOW`, `UTIME_OMIT`

      * `io/fcntl.h [__USE_ATFILE]`

        Do we support `AT_FDCWD` et al.?

      * `MAP_POPULATE` (`mmap`, `sys/mman.h`) -- *Populate (prefault)
        pagetables.*

        Some Linux kernel version, `mm/mmap.c`:

                if (vm_flags & VM_LOCKED) {
                        if (!mlock_vma_pages_range(vma, addr, addr + len))
                                mm->locked_vm += (len >> PAGE_SHIFT);
                } else if ((flags & MAP_POPULATE) && !(flags & MAP_NONBLOCK))
                        make_pages_present(addr, addr + len);
                return addr;

        `t/mmap`.

        Is only advisory, so can worked around with `#define 0`.

      * `t/opendirat`: `opendirat` (`scandirat`, `scandirat64`)

        Need changes equivalent to c55fbd1ea768f9fdef34a01377702c0d72cbc213 +
        14d96785125abee5e9a49a1c3037f35a581750bd.

      * `madvise`, `MADV_DONTNEED`

        [[glibc_madvise_vs_static_linking]].

      * `msync`

        Then define `_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES`, `_POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO`.

      * `sys/epoll.h`

        Used by [[wayland]], for example.

      * `sys/eventfd.h`

      * `sys/inotify.h`

      * `sys/signalfd.h`

      * `sys/timerfd.h`

      * `timespec_get` (74033a2507841cf077e31221de2481ff30b43d51)

      * `waitflags.h` (`WEXITED`, `WNOWAIT`, `WSTOPPED`, `WCONTINUED`)

        IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-04-20:

            <pinotree> in glibc, we use the generic waitflags.h which, unlike
              linux's version, does not define WEXITED, WNOWAIT, WSTOPPED,
              WCONTINUED
            <pinotree> should the generic bits/waitflags.h define them anyway,
              since they are posix?
            <youpi> well, we'd have to implement them anyway
            <youpi> but otherwise, I'd say yes
            <pinotree> sure, but since glibc headers should expose at least
              everything declared by posix, i thought they should be defined
              anyway
            <youpi> that might bring bugs
            <youpi> some applications might be #ifdefing them
            <youpi> and break when they are defined but not working
            <pinotree> i guess they would define them to 0, andd having them to
              non-zero values shouldn't break them (since those values don't do
              anything, so they would act as if they were 0.. or not?)
            <youpi> no, I mean they would do something else, not define them to
              0
            <pinotree> like posix/tst-waitid.c, you mean?
            <youpi> yes

      * `getconf` things

        IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-10-03

            <pinotree> getconf -a | grep CACHE
            <Tekk_> pinotree: I hate spoiling data, but 0 :P
            <pinotree> had that feeling, but wanted to be sure -- thanks!
            <Tekk_> http://dpaste.com/809519/
            <Tekk_> except for uhh
            <Tekk_> L4 linesize
            <Tekk_> that didn't have any number associated
            <pinotree> weird
            <Tekk_> I actually didn't even know that there was L4 cache
            <pinotree> what do you get if you run `getconf
              LEVEL4_CACHE_LINESIZE`?
            <Tekk_> pinotree: undefined
            <pinotree> expected, given the output above

    For specific packages:

      * [[octave]]

  * Create `t/cleanup_kernel-features.h`.

  * Add tests from Linux kernel commit messages for `t/dup3` et al.

  * In `sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/Makefile`, there are a bunch of
    `-DHAVE_SENDFILE` -- but we do have `sendfile`, too.

  * `/usr/include/pthread.h` overwrite issue

    `make`, after editing `nss/nss_db/db-initgroups.c`:

        [...]
        make[2]: Leaving directory `/media/erich/home/thomas/tmp/glibc/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker/resolv'

    See [[!message-id "871uv99c59.fsf@kepler.schwinge.homeip.net"]].  Passing
    `install_root=/INVALID` to `make`/`make check` is a cheap cure.  For `make
    install`, prepending an additional slash to `install_root` (that is,
    `install_root=//[...]`) is enough to obfuscate the Makefile rules.

  * `sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/syslog.c`

  * `fsync` on a pipe

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-08-21:

        <braunr> pinotree: i think gnu_srs spotted a conformance problem in
          glibc
        <pinotree> (only one?)
        <braunr> pinotree: namely, fsync on a pipe (which is actually a
          socketpair) doesn't return EINVAL when the "operation not supported"
          error is returned as a "bad request message ID"
        <braunr> pinotree: what do you think of this case ?
        <pinotree> i'm far from an expert on such stuff, but seems a proper E*
          should be returned
        <braunr> (there also is a problem in clisp falling in an infinite loop
          when trying to handle this, since it uses fsync inside the error
          handling code, eww, but we don't care :p)
        <braunr> basically, here is what clisp does
        <braunr> if fsync fails, and the error isn't EINVAL, let's report the
          error
        <braunr> and reporting the error in turn writes something on the
          output/error stream, which in turn calls fsync again
        <pinotree> smart
        <braunr> after the stack is exhausted, clisp happily crashes
        <braunr> gnu_srs: i'll alter the clisp code a bit so it knows about our
          mig specific error
        <braunr> if that's the problem (which i strongly suspect), the solution
          will be to add an error conversion for fsync so that it returns
          EINVAL
        <braunr> if pinotree is willing to do that, he'll be the only one
          suffering from the dangers of sending stuff to the glibc maintainers
          :p
        <pinotree> that shouldn't be an issue i think, there are other glibc
          hurd implementations that do such checks
        <gnu_srs> does fsync return EINVAL for other OSes?
        <braunr>        EROFS, EINVAL
        <braunr>               fd is bound to a special file which does not
          support synchronization.
        <braunr> obviously, pipes and sockets don't
        <pinotree>
          http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fsync.html
        <braunr> so yes, other OSes do just that
        <pinotree> now that you speak about it, it could be the failure that
          the gnulib fsync+fdatasync testcase have when being run with `make
          check` (although not when running as ./test-foo)
        <braunr> hm we may not need change glibc
        <braunr> clisp has a part where it defines a macro IS_EINVAL which is
          system specific
        <braunr> (but we should change it in glibc for conformance anyway)
        <braunr> #elif defined(UNIX_DARWIN) || defined(UNIX_FREEBSD) ||
          defined(UNIX_NETBSD) || defined(UNIX_OPENBSD) #define IS_EINVAL_EXTRA
          ((errno==EOPNOTSUPP)||(errno==ENOTSUP)||(errno==ENODEV))
        <pinotree> i'd rather add nothing to clisp
        <braunr> let's see what posix says
        <braunr> EINVAL
        <braunr> so right, we should simply convert it in glibc
        <gnu_srs> man fsync mentions EINVAL
        <braunr> man pages aren't posix, even if they are usually close
        <gnu_srs> aha
        <pinotree> i think checking for MIG_BAD_ID and EOPNOTSUPP (like other
          parts do) will b enough
        <pinotree> *be
        <braunr> gnu_srs: there, it finished correctly even when piped
        <gnu_srs> I saw that, congrats!
        <braunr> clisp is quite tricky to debug
        <braunr> i never had to deal with a program that installs break points
          and handles segfaults itself in order to implement growing stacks :p
        <braunr> i suppose most interpreters do that
        <gnu_srs> So the permanent change will be in glibc, not clisp?
        <braunr> yes

        <gnu_srs1> pinotree: The changes needed for fsync.c is at
          http://paste.debian.net/185379/ if you want to try it out (confirmed
          with rbraun)
        <youpi> I agree with the patch, posix indeed documents einval as the
          "proper"  error value
        <pinotree> there's fdatasync too
        <pinotree> other places use MIG_BAD_ID instead of EMIG_BAD_ID
        <braunr> pinotree: i assume that if you're telling us, it's because
          they have different values
        <pinotree> braunr: tbh i never seen the E version, and everywhere in
          glibc the non-E version is used
        <gnu_srs1> in sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/errno.h only the E version is
          defined
        <pinotree> look in gnumach/include/mach/mig_errors.h
        <pinotree> (as the comment in errno.h say)
        <gnu_srs1> mig_errors.h yes. Which comment: from errors.h: /* Errors
          from <mach/mig_errors.h>.  */ and then the EMIG_ stuff?
        <gnu_srs1> Which one is used when building libc?
        <gnu_srs1> Answer: At least in fsync.c errno.h is used: #include
          <errno.h>
        <gnu_srs1> Yes, fdatasync.c should be patched too.
        <gnu_srs1> pinotree: You are right: EMIG_ or MIG_ is confusing. 
        <gnu_srs1> /usr/include/i386-gnu/bits/errno.h:     /* Errors from
          <mach/mig_errors.h>.  */

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-09-02:

        <antrik> braunr: regarding fsync(), I agree that EOPNOTSUPP probably
          should be translated to EINVAL, if that's what POSIX says. it does
          *not* sound right to translate MIG_BAD_ID though. the server should
          explicitly return EOPNOTSUPP, and that's what the default trivfs stub
          does. if you actually do see MIG_BAD_ID, there must be some other
          bug...
        <braunr> antrik: right, pflocal doesn't call the trivfs stub for socket
          objects
        <braunr> trivfs_demuxer is only called by the pflocal node demuxer, for
          socket objects it's another call, and i don't think it's the right
          thing to call trivfs_demuxer there either
        <pinotree> handling MAG_BAD_ID isn't a bad idea anyway, you never know
          what the underlying server actually implements
        <pinotree> (imho)
        <braunr> for me, a bad id is the same as a not supported operation
        <pinotree> ditto
        <pinotree> from fsync's POV, both the results are the same anyway, ie
          that the server does not support a file_sync operation
        <antrik> no, a bad ID means the server doesn't implement the protocol
          (or not properly at least)
        <antrik> it's usually a bug IMHO
        <antrik> there is a reason we have EOPNOTSUPP for operations that are
          part of a protocol but not implemented by a particular server
        <pinotree> antrik: even if it could be the case, there's no reason to
          make fsync fail anyway
        <antrik> pinotree: I think there is. it indicates a bug, which should
          not be hidden
        <pinotree> well, patches welcome then...
        <antrik> thing is, if sock objects are actually not supposed to
          implement the file interface, glibc shouldn't even *try* to call
          fsync on them
        <pinotree> how?
        <pinotree> i mean, can you check whether the file interface is not
          implemented, without doing a roundtrip^
        <pinotree> ?
        <antrik> well, the sock objects are not files, i.e. they were *not*
          obtained by file_name_lookup(), but rather a specific call. so glibc
          actually *knows* that they are not files.
        <braunr> antrik: this way of thinking means we need an "fd" protocol
        <braunr> so that objects accessed through a file descriptor implement
          all fd calls
        <antrik> now I wonder though whether there are conceivable use cases
          where it would make sense for objects obtained through the socket
          call to optionally implement the file interface...
        <antrik> which could actually make sense, if libc lets through other
          file calls as well (which I guess it does, if the sock ports are
          wrapped in normal fd structures?)
        <braunr> antrik: they are
        <braunr> and i'd personally be in favor of such an fd protocol, even if
          it means implementing stubs for many useless calls
        <braunr> but the way things are now suggest a bad id really means an
          operation is simply not supported
        <antrik> the question in this case is whether we should make the file
          protocol mandatory for anything that can end up in an FD; or whether
          we should keep it optional, and add the MIG_BAD_ID calls to *all* FD
          operations
        <antrik> (there is no reason for fsync to be special in this regard)
        <braunr> yes
        <antrik> braunr: BTW, I'm rather undecided whether the right approach
          is a) requiring an FD interface collection, b) always checking
          MIG_BAD_ID, or perhaps c) think about introducing a mechanism to
          explicitly query supported interfaces...

    IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2012-09-03:

        <braunr> antrik: querying interfaces sounds like an additional penalty
          on performance
        <antrik> braunr: the query usually has to be done only once. in fact it
          could be integrated into the name lookup...
        <braunr> antrik: once for every object
        <braunr> antrik: yes, along with the lookup would be a nice thing

        <pinotree> youpi: uhm, in glibc we use
          stdio-common/f{,try,un}lockfile.c, which do nothing (as opposed to eg
          the nptl versions, which do lock/trylock/unlock); do you know more
          about them?
        <youpi> pinotree: ouch
        <youpi> no, I don't know
        <youpi> well, I do know what they're supposed to do
        <pinotree> i'm trying fillig them, let's see
        <youpi> but not why we don't have them
        <youpi> (except that libpthread is "recent")
        <youpi> yet another reason to build libpthread in glibc, btw
        <youpi> oh, but we do provide lockfile in libpthread, don't we ?
        <youpi> pinotree: yes, and libc has weak variants, so the libpthread
          will take over
        <pinotree> youpi: sure, but that in stuff linking to pthreads
        <pinotree> if you do a simple application doing eg main() { fopen +
          fwrite + fclose }, you get no locking
        <youpi> so?
        <youpi> if you don't have threads, you don't need locks :)
        <pinotree> ... unless there is some indirect recursion
        <youpi> ?
        <pinotree> basically, i was debugging why glibc tests with mtrace() and
          ending with muntrace() would die (while tests without muntrace call
          wouldn't)
        <youpi> well, I still don't see what a lock will bring
        <pinotree> if you look at the muntrace implementation (in
          malloc/mtrace.c), basically fclose can trigger a malloc hook (because
          of the free for the FILE*)
        <youpi> either you have threads, and it's need, or you don't, and it's
          a nop
        <youpi> yes, and ?
        <braunr> does the signal thread count ?
        <youpi> again, in linux, when you don't have threads, the lock is a nop
        <youpi> does the signal thread use IO ?
        <braunr> that's the question :)
        <braunr> i hope not
        <youpi> IIRC the signal thread just manages signals, and doesn't
          execute the handler itself
        <braunr> sure
        <braunr> i was more thinking about debug stuff
        <youpi> can't hurt to add them anyway, but let me still doubt that it'd
          fix muntrace, I don't see why it would, unless you have threads
        <pinotree> that's what i'm going next
        <pinotree> pardon, it seems i got confused a bit
        <pinotree> it'd look like a genuine muntrace bug (muntrace → fclose →
          free hook → lock lock → fprint (since the FILE is still set) → malloc
          → malloc hook → lock lock → spin)
        <pinotree> at least i got some light over the flockfile stuff, thanks
          ;)
        <pinotree> youpi: otoh, __libc_lock_lock (etc) are noop in the base
          implementation, while doing real locks on hurd in any case, and on
          linux only if nptl is loaded, it seems
        <pinotree> that would explain why on linux you get no deadlock
        <youpi> unless using nptl, that is?
        <pinotree> hm no, even with pthread it works
        <pinotree> but hey, at least the affected glibc test now passes
        <pinotree> will maybe try to do investigation on why it works on linux
          tomorrow

### Additional Failures Compared to Debian

    $ bash ~/tmp/glibc/debian/eglibc-2.13/debian/testsuite-checking/convertlog.sh log_test  > log_test.filtered
    $ bash ~/tmp/glibc/debian/eglibc-2.13/debian/testsuite-checking/compare.sh ~/tmp/glibc/debian/eglibc-2.13/debian/testsuite-checking/expected-results-i486-gnu-libc log_test.filtered

  * `bug-atexit3.out`, `debug/tst-chk4`, `debug/tst-chk5`, `debug/tst-chk6`,
    `debug/tst-lfschk4`, `debug/tst-lfschk5`, `debug/tst-lfschk6`

        dlopen failed: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

    See [[!message-id "20090420002344.11798.qmail@s461.sureserver.com"]].
    Hacked around with `ln -s /usr/lib/i386-*gnu/libstdc++.so.6
    /lib/i386-*gnu/libpthread-stubs.so.0 /lib/i386-*gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 ./`.
    This is a bug in the glibc test harness.  Should probably use some
    `configure` magic akin to the `fixincludes` stuff (`gcc-4.4
    -print-file-name=libstdc++.so.6`, etc.).

  * `debug/tst-chk4`, `debug/tst-chk5`, `debug/tst-chk6`, `debug/tst-lfschk4`,
    `debug/tst-lfschk5`, `debug/tst-lfschk6`

    Fail in the same way as the C ones, `tst-chk1..3`.

  * `io/ftwtest`, `posix/globtest`, `iconvdata/iconv-test`, `intl/tst-gettext`,
    `malloc/tst-mtrace`, `elf/tst-pathopt`, `iconvdata/tst-tables`,
    `grp/tst_fgetgrent`, `dlfcn/tststatic`, `dlfcn/tststatic2`,
    `posix/wordexp-tst`, `localedata/bug-setlocale1.out`, `posix/tst-getconf`

        /home/thomas/tmp/glibc/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker.build-gcc-4.4-486.O/io/ftwtest: error while loading shared libraries: libmachuser.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

    Looking into `localedata/bug-setlocale1.c`, it is clear what it going on:
    only the root of the build directory is added for `--library-path`, but
    none of the other directories that are additionally used.  This is a bug in
    the glibc test harness.  Hacked around by `ln -s mach/libmachuser.so.1
    hurd/libhurduser.so.0.3 ./`.  Hopefully the other instances are similar.

  * `posix/tst-getconf`

    Ends with:

        getconf POSIX_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN /: /home/thomas/tmp/glibc/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker.build-gcc-4.4-486/posix/getconf: pathconf: /: Invalid argument

  * `dlfcn/tststatic`, `dlfcn/tststatic2`

    No output, SEGFAULT.

  * `math/test-idouble`, `math/test-ifloat`, `math/test-ildoubl`,
    `math/test-ldouble`

    SIGSEGV.

  * `rt/tst-aio10`, `rt/tst-aio9`

        /home/thomas/tmp/glibc/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker.build-gcc-4.4-486.O/rt/tst-aio10.o: In function `do_test':

    `rt/tst-mqueue8`, `elf/tst-thrlock`, `rt/tst-timer3`,
    `nss//libnss_test1.so`

    Compilation: missing `pthread_attr_init`, `pthread_barrier_init`,
    `pthread_create`, etc.

  * `elf/tst-audit1`, `elf/tst-audit2`

    SIGKILL.

  * `inet/tst-ether_line`

        tst-ether_line.c:19: error: 'ETH_ALEN' undeclared (first use in this function)

    Will either need a `hurd/netinet/if_ether.h` that includes
    `<net/if_ether.h>`, or can do that in the generic `netinet/if_ether.h`?
    See also [[!sourceware_bug 11142]].

  * `gmon/tst-sprofil`

        Floating point exception

  * `posix/bug-regex31-mem`, `posix/tst-fnmatch-mem`

    *output* files: some memory not freed.

  * `assert/test-assert.out`

    Fails sometimes...

  * `stdlib/bug-getcontext.out`

        getcontext failed, errno: 1073741902.

    Is not implemented; see above.

  * `elf/tst-unique3lib.so`, `elf/tst-unique3lib2.so`, `elf/tst-unique4lib.so`

    Only with GCC 4.4; no longer with 4.5 or 4.6:

        /home/thomas/tmp/glibc/tschwinge/Roger_Whittaker.build-gcc-4.4-486/elf/tst-unique3lib.os:(.data.DW.ref.__gxx_personality_v0[DW.ref.__gxx_personality_v0]+0x0): undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_v0'

  * `math/test-fenv.out`

    Used to fail (is listed in Debian eglibc-2.13-21's
    `expected-results-i486-gnu-libc`), but something between
    22bcba37dd3b782b1a1ec7bf51da468e48f4d2eb and
    005b7594ffe209639dd1ef2b9ed9a4c22307dec1 causes it to passe -- very likely
    Jérémie's signaling work.

  * `posix/tst-waitid.out`

    Fails sometimes (is listed in Debian eglibc-2.13-21's
    `expected-results-i486-gnu-libc`).

  * `elf/tst-unused-dep.out` (1f393a11f65dcaa1952bdcaf0317a65a5f8aff9d,
    [[!sourceware_bug 13706]], [[!message-id "4F4210C1.1090704@redhat.com"]])

## OLD

`configure --without-cvs --prefix= --disable-profile --build=i486-gnu
--host=i486-gnu`

`make -k check` changes from 538603af899057a9ef9583cc447804ec602a45e5 to
c9fd33ef070def49c078c94f8d9bc9f8a8e267f7.

Configured with `--prefix=/usr` instead of `--prefix=`.

Resolved failures:

  * localedata/tst_mblen.out
  * localedata/tst_mbrlen.out
  * localedata/tst_mbrtowc.out
  * localedata/tst_mbsrtowcs.out

  * localedata/tst-wctype.out
  * math/test-float.out
  * math/test-double.out
  * posix/tst-vfork3-mem
  * io/tst-mkdirat.out

New:

  * A lot of `error while loading shared libraries: libmachuser.so.1: cannot
    open shared object file: No such file or directory`.  Is it perhaps picking
    that library up from `$prefix/lib/`?

    New failures; likely due to that:

      * iconvdata/iconv-test.out
      * iconvdata/tst-tables.out
      * malloc/tst-mtrace.out
      * grp/tst_fgetgrent.out
      * posix/globtest.out
      * posix/wordexp-tst.out
      * io/ftwtest.out
      * elf/tst-pathopt.out

    Changed failures; likely due to that:

      * debug/tst-chk4.out / debug/tst-chk5.out

            -error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
            +error while loading shared libraries: libpthread-stubs.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
