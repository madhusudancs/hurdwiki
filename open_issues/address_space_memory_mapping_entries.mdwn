    <braunr> and as a last example: memory mapping is heavily used in the hurd,
      but for some reason, the map entries in an address space are still on a
      linked list
    <braunr> a bare linked list
    <braunr> which makes faults and page cache lookups even slower

A [[red-black tree|gnumach_vm_map_red-black_trees]] was added to VM maps to
speed up lookups.
