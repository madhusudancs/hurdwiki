# console switching and DMs

Something like VT_ACTIVATE would need to be implemented to allow console
switching. In the meanwhile xorg refuses the vtx option, thus making lightdm &
such fail with an Xserver error:

       (EE) Fatal server error:
       (EE) Unrecognized option: vt7

In the meanwhile DMs could be taught not to use the vtx option.

    <braunr> hum
    <braunr> it looks like the xorg keyboard driver evolved and now uses ioctls
      our drivers don't implement
    <braunr> thanks for the report, we'll have to work on this
    <braunr> i'm not sure the problem is new actually
