There are [[several aspects to security|/security]] that are (mainly) relevant
to the design space.

There are also security issues in the implemenation space, for example using
the correct coding paradigms.

Large parts of our code base have not beed audited, either manually or in an
automated fashion.

[[Unit testing]] is one aspect: testing for reliably failing for invalid input.

[[Code analysis]] is another aspect.

All publically usable interfaces provide attacking targets.  This includes all
[[system call]]s and [[RPC]] interfaces.

Fuzzing techniques can be use for locating possible issues; see discussion on
the [[code_analysis]] page.
