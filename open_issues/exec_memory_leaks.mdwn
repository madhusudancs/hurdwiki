    <braunr> the exec servers seems to leak a lot
    <braunr> server*
    <braunr> exec now uses 109M on darnassus
    <braunr> it really leaks a lot
    <pinotree> only 109mb? few months ago, exec on exodar was taking more than
      200mb after few days of uptime with builds done
    <braunr> i wonder how much it takes on the buildds

    <braunr> the exec leak is tricky
    <braunr> bddebian: btw, look at the TODO file in the hurd source code
    <braunr> bddebian: there is a not from thomas bushnell about that
    <braunr> "*** Handle dead name notifications on execserver ports. !
    <braunr> not sure it's still a todo item, but it might be worth checking
    <bddebian> braunr: diskfs_execboot_class = ports_create_class (0, 0);
      This is what would need to change right?  It should call some cleanup
      routine in the first argument?
    <bddebian> Would be ideal if it could just use deadboot() from exec.
    <braunr> bddebian: possible
    <braunr> bddebian: hum execboot, i'm not so sure
    <bddebian> Execboot is the exec task, no?
    <braunr> i don't know what execboot is
    <bddebian> It's from libdiskfs
    <braunr> but "diskfs_execboot_class" looks like a class of ports used at
      startup only
    <braunr> ah
    <braunr> then it's something run in the diskfs users ?
    <bddebian> yes
    <braunr> the leak is in exec
    <braunr> if clients misbehave, it shouldn't affect that server
    <bddebian> That's a different issue, this was about the TODO thing 
    <braunr> ah
    <braunr> i don't know
    <bddebian> Me either :)
    <bddebian> For the leak I'm still focusing on do-bunzip2 but I am baffled
      at my results..
    <braunr> ?
    <bddebian> Where my counters are zero if I always increment on different
      vars but wild freaking numbers if I increment on malloc and decrement on
      free

After twelve hours worth of `fork/exec` ([[GCC]]'s `check-c` part of the
testsuite), we got:

      PID  UID  PPID  PGrp  Sess TH  Vmem   RSS %CPU     User   System Args
        4    0     3     1     1 10  392M  262M  0.0  2:18.29     2hrs /hurd/exec

The *RSS* seems a tad high.  Also the system part of CPU time consumption is
quite noticeable.  In comparison:

    * braunr hunting the exec leak
    <braunr> and i think i found it
    <braunr> yes :>
    <braunr> testing a bit more and committing the fix later tonight
    <braunr> pinotree: i've been building glibc for 40 mins and exec is still
      consuming around 1m memory
    <pinotree> wow nice
    <pinotree> i've been noticing exec leaking quite some time ago, then forgot
      to pay more attention to that
    <braunr> it's been more annoying since darnassus provides web access to
      cgis
    <braunr> automated tools make requests every seconds
    <braunr> the leak occurred when starting a shell script or using system()
    <braunr> youpi: not sure you saw it, i fixed the exec leak


## IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2013-10-10

    <gg0> braunr: http://postimg.org/image/jd764wfpp/
    <braunr> exec 797M
    <braunr> this should be fixed with the release of the next hurd packages
