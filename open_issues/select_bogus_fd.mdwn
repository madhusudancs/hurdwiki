# Python

IRC, freenode, #hurd, 2011-04-13

    <abeaumont> ok, cause of first python testsuite failure located, now the
      hard part, how to best fix it :)
    <abeaumont> how to redesign the code to avoid the problem... that's the
      hard part, mostly cause i lack contextual info
    <abeaumont> tschwinge: the problem is pretty much summarized by this
      comment in _hurd_select (in glibc): /* If one descriptor is bogus, we
      fail completely.  */
    <pochu> does POSIX say anything about what to do if one fd is invalid?
    <pochu> and the other question is why python is calling select() with an
      invalid fd
    <abeaumont> pochu: yep, it says it should not fail completelly
    <pochu> then that's our bug :)
    <pinotree> abeaumont: just note that (at least on debian) some tests may
      hang forever or cause hurd/mach to die
    <pinotree> abeaumont: see in the debian/rules of the packaging of each
      pythonX.Y source
    <pinotree> ... there's a list of the tests excluded from the test suite run
    <abeaumont> well, to be precise, python has a configure check for
      'broken_poll' which hurd fails, and therefore python's select module is
      not built, and anything depending on it fails
    <abeaumont> broken_poll checks exactly for that posix requirement
    <abeaumont> the reason for python using a non-existant
      descriptor... unknown :D
    <pochu> we should fix select to not fail miserably in that case
    <pinotree> abeaumont: we have a patch to fix the broken poll check to
      actually disable the poll module
    <pochu> pinotree: but the proper fix is to fix select(), which is what
      abeaumont is looking at
    <abeaumont> pinotree: i'd say that's exactly what python's configure check
      does itself -- disable building the select module
    <pochu> abeaumont: what pinotree means is that the check is broken, see
      http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/python2.6/2.6.6-8/hurd-broken-poll.diff
    <pinotree> yes, the configure check for poll does the check, but not
      everything of the poll module gets disabled (and you get a build failure)
