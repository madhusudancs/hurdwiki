# listing running domUs

    $ sudo xm list

    $ sudo xm top

# handling running domUs

Forcefully killing a domU (that has crashed or is busy-looping, etc.):

    $ sudo xm destroy [domU]

As for (re-)starting a domU, read below in *domU consoles*.

Using `xm shutdown [domU]` to gracefully shut down a running domU does not yet
work -- this is not yet implemented in the [[Xen port of GNU
Mach|microkernel/mach/gnumach/ports/xen]] ([[!taglink open_issue_xen]]).

# domU consoles

To avoid any complications with people trying to use the same console at the
same time, please use this command for attaching to a domU's console (this
command line will also start the domU in case that it isn't running already):

    $ host=[domU] && sudo screen -DRRS console-$host sh -c "xm console $host || xm create -c $host"

Otherwise, if one attaches to the same console twice, the second instance will
in fact forward input to the domU (possibly infering with what the person is
doing on the first instance), but the output won't be sent back to the second
instance.

After having typed this once, Bash's `reverse-search-history` (`C-r`), followed
by typing in `host=flubber`, for example, will be enough to get access to
that machine's console.

/!\ TODO: How does one get the environment variables `COLUMNS` and `LINES` set
properly when using `xm console`?  According to Samuel, *you don't, the xen
console doesn't have the notion of terminal size*.  This is relevant for
everything using `(n)curses` -- for interactive console applications.  Using
`export COLUMNS=143 LINES=44` does work, but is a manual process.
