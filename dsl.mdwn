[[!meta title="DSL"]]

A *DSL* is a *domain-specific language* ([[!wikipedia Domain-specific_language
desc="Wikipedia article"]]).

Compared to general-purpose programming languages, these are a candidate for
[[open_issues/formal_verification]].

DSLs are frequently used as [[IDL]]s for implementing [[RPC]] systems, but can
also used for other portions of the [[kernel]], such as [[capability]] systems.
This is exemplified for [[microkernel/Barrelfish]] in
{{$microkernel/barrelfish#fof_plos09}}, for example.
