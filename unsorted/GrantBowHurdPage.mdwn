Here are some notes on my current Hurd activity.

I am also unable to get my PCI NE-2000 clone network card working. The driver loads but no routes are possible and therefore no packets get to the network. This is actually a DE-220 NIC that I started to discuss on hurd-help. Here's the actual change I made to gnumach-20020421/linux/dev/drivers/net/Space.c

       static struct device eth0_dev = {
           "eth0", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0x240, 10, 0, 0, 0, &eth1_dev, ethif_probe };

Cheers,

Booting OSKit-Mach mysteriously works now! Yeah! I didn't even change anything!

My problems now is how to get my second machine's (hd0,2) (/dev/hda3 for linux folks) partitionto bre recognized by Grub. When I try 'root (hd0,2)' grub spits back 'Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x83'. This is a standard ext2 /boot partition from my test Progeny install. I even removed the partition, added it back, fsck.ext2 and moved the files back. It still doesn't see the -filesystem-. Very strange. This prevents me from using my second machine right now.

If anyone knows more about these items, please add your comments below with your signature.

PLEASE read these once. They are worth the effort.

I am working on a page describing the [[Distrib/GNUDebianBuildProcess]].

I also created some very very rough images for use in explaining the Hurd and it's relationship with GNU Mach and Oskit Mach.
